These pages also reflect thefirst-hand experience of one of the authors in investigating and prosecuting illicit lendersand conversations with observers of and persons engaged in organized crime. In citing theliterature, the authors do not wish to vouch for its unwavering accuracy. The study of anyillegal activity poses severe problems. For this reason and others, existing materials tend tobe sketchy, speculative, unduly sensationalized, and largely out of date. Nonetheless, thevast majority of statements made in the text (including those for which outside materialsare cited) reflects the views of the authors; equivocal phrasing, on the other hand, gener-ally indicates the authors' uncertainty as to the truth of the matter asserted. Notwithstand-ing this caveat, the authors believe that the first section taken as a whole accurately de-scribes the realities of loansharking.<pagebreak>                     CORNELL LAW REVIEW                                     [Vol. 65:127IV.

SHAKESPEARE, The Merchant of Venice, in THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SHAKESPEARE 247 (I. Ribner & G. Kittredge eds. 1971).      2 W. SHAKESPEARE, The Merchant of Venice, supra note 1, at Act I, Scene III, lines 141- 46:        If you repay me not on such a day,        In such a place, such sum or sums as are        Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit        Be nominated for an equal pound        Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken        In what part of your body pleaseth me.                                     (Shylock to Bassanio)     3 This etymology may be more a matter of lore than fact. Others have indicated thatthe work "loanshark" derives from the illicit lenders' shark-like characteristics; loansharkslike their acquatic namesakes prey on people and are given to violence. The term "shark"has long denoted a greedy and parasitic person-a meaning which, some linguists theorize,preceded and accounted for the name assigned the fish. See E. PARTRIDGE, ORIGINS: ASHORT ETYMOLOGICAL DICTIONARY OF MODERN ENGLISH 614 (1958); W. W. SKEAT,ETYMOLOGICAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 545 (1882); E. WEEKLY,ETYMOLOGICAL DICTIONARY OF MODERN ENGLISH 1328 (1921). Given this meaning of theword "shark," it seems likely that the work "loanshark" is a simple compound tying thecharacteristics of the "shark" to the practice of making loans.     4 Impact of Crime on Small Business: Hearings Before the Senate Select Comm. on Small Busi-ness, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 94 (1968) (statement of Charles Siragusa, Executive Dir., Ill.<pagebreak>                              CORNELL LAW REVIEW                               [Vol. 65:127        The term "loanshark" lacks a precise definition; neither lin- guists nor lawyers have concentrated on the term, 5 and different generations have assigned the term differing connotations.6There was no common-law crime of "loansharking," and modernstatutes aimed at the problem proscribe a wide array of practices. In current usage, however, "loansharking" plainly embodies twocentral features: the assessment of exorbitant interest rates in ex-tending loans and the use of threats and violence in collecting          8them.        Contemporary loansharking, however defined, exactssignificant social costs. Estimates in 1967 placed loansharking asthe fifth-ranking crime in financial cost to society. 9 In addition totransferring wealth to criminal elements and burdening law en-forcement budgets, loansharking causes economic inefficiencies.' ¡Moreover, loansharking feeds upon and reinforces the climate ofviolence and fear perpetuated by organized crime." For manyCrime Investigating Comm'n) [hereinafter cited as Small Business Hearings].      I Neither BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (4th ed. 1968) nor BALLENTINE'S LAW DICTIONARY(3d ed. 1969) define the word "loanshark." The RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF THEENGLISH LANGUAGE (1966) defines "loanshark" as "a person who lends money at excessiverates of interest; usurer" (id. at 840), and "shark" as, "a person who preys greedily onothers, as by cheating or usury" (id. at 1311). WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONALDICTIONARY 1326 (3d ed. 1961) defines "loan shark" as "one who lends money to individu-als at extortionate interest rates." 2 OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 712 (Supp. 1971) de- fines the term as one "who exacts usurious rates of interest from the person of smallmeans.        See generally notes 57-87 and accompanying text infra.      7 Relevant laws prohibit criminal usury, extortionate lending, extortionate collecting,receiving profits of illicit credit transactions, and financing illicit loans. See Appendix Ainfra.      I One commentator has identified the three major elements of modern loansharkingas:            (1) the lending of cash at very high rates of interest;            (2) a borrower-lender agreement based on the borrower's willingness to       put up   his own and his family's physical well-being as collateral; and            (3) the borrower's belief that the lender is connected with ruthless criminal       organizations.See Seidl, "Upon the Hip"-A Study of the Criminal Loan-Shark Industry 30 (Dec. 1968)(unpublished Ph.D. thesis in Harvard University Library).      I U.S. TASK FORCE ON ASSESSMENT, PRESIDENT'S COMM'N ON LAW ENFORCEMENT & An-MINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, TASK FORCE REPORT: CRIME AND ITS IMPACT-AN ASSESSMENT43 n.6 (1967) [hereinafter cited as TASK FORCE REPORT].    'o Undoubtedly some element of monopoly power, possibly transient, exists in mostloansharking transactions.

The President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice in 1968 pegged loansharking as the second most profitable branch of organized crime 19-an industry viewed as skimming off as much as two per- cent of the gross national product. 20 Other observers estimated that the loansharking business produces over $10 billion a year on a $5 billion investment. 2 ' Current income from loansharking is uncertain, but there is no indication that the growth of illegallending has abated. Indeed, increased law enforcement efforts tocurb other criminal ventures may be channeling underworld activ-ity into lending and increasing the loansharking take.22        In addition to providing direct income, loansharking in-creases the scope and profitability of the underworld's other illicitenterprises. 23 A distinguishing feature of organized crime is theability of syndicate members to capitalize on opportunities that re-sult from connections with diverse actors and activities.2 4 Loan-     "sSee   N.Y.

The syndicate remains in the background, insulation and security are increased, and profits remain high. In fact, a monopoly on the financing of a business may provide the syndi- cate with most of the profits usually available through direct con- trol of the underlying operation.2 5          Extortionate credit transactions also provide underworld ele- ments with an ideal vehicle for infiltrating legitimate businesses and gaining control over "outside" individuals.26 Once in the grip of organized crime, businesses may be run legitimately as fronts, run for profit with illegal competitive advantages, or stripped of assets at the expense of unsuspecting creditors.27 In- dividuals may be forced to commit crimes, abuse their discretion         (2) arranged to sell it on the Japanese black market (the connection was a         Californian who dealt in stolen credit cards with an acquaintance of the sub-        ject); and         (3) distributed it within the United States (the connection was a Philadelphian         who had been involved with the subject in security swindles). 1 NATIONAL COMM'N FOR THE REVIEW OF FED. & STATE LAWS RELATING TO WIRETAPPING &ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE, COMMISSION HEARINGS 413-74 (1976).       For a discussion of the relationship of enterprises to syndicates, see G.R.

If the profit-         maximizing price for a monopolist producing both ingot and pipe is $100, the         monopoly profit is $25. Observe that the sole seller of ingot can sell ingot for         $65 to fabricators who, if they are numerous, will compete vigorously, thereby         forcing pipe prices down to their $100 production cost. P.

Onenewspaper report claimed that organized crime has a strong influence in over 10,000"legitimate" businesses, including construction companies, bakeries, and banks. The ac-count cites two reasons for this development. First, profits from organized crime's otherillicit activities are too great to merely reinvest in those activities. Second, involvement inlegitimate businesses decreases the possibility of detection by law enforcement officials.Wall St. J., Apr. 19, 1968, at 48, col. 1.

The Economics of Loansharking       As with all markets, economic analysis of lending focuses on the dynamics of supply and demand. In simplest terms, loan-sharking exists because a demand for the loanshark's servicesexists.         This demand results at least in part from legally im-posed interest-rate ceilings that preclude legal lenders from satis-fying the demand of high-risk borrowers. 3 ' A free market wouldrespond to such demand by generating high-interest loans. Usurylaws, however, prohibit financial institutions from servicing theseborrowers. The loanshark fills the resulting gap between marketdemand and legal supply.       Factors other than the borrowers' inability to obtain legalcredit help explain the intense demand for loanshark services.Complexity, formality, and a lack of secrecy drive some borrowersaway from financial institutions to uncomplicated, convenienttransactions with loansharks.3 2 Rarely, however, do the advan-tages of loanshark transactions outweigh the exorbitant rates andrisk of violence that mark this form of borrowing. Desperation,not convenience, accounts for the prosperity of the 'juice man."As one former loanshark stated:             People who borrow from a juice operation do so only be-      cause they really need it after they have been frozen out of    28 See, e.g., McClellan, Weak Link in Our War on the Mafia, READERS DIGEST REPRINT,reprinted in Subcommittee #5 Hearings, supra note 12, at 112-13 (New York City Water Com- missioner forced to give $40,000 kickback).    29 See notes 134-39, 171-79 and accompanying text infra.    30 No comprehensive analysis has ever been made of what kinds of customers        loan sharks have, or of how much or how often each kind borrows. Enforce-        ment officials and other investigators do have some information. Gamblers        borrow to pay gambling losses; narcotics users borrow to purchase heroin.        Some small businessmen borrow from loan sharks when legitimate credit       channels are closed. The same men who take bets from employees in mass        employment industries also serve at times as loan sharks whose money enables        the employees to pay off their gambling debts or meet household needs. TASK FORCE REPORT: ORGANIZED CRIME, supra note 15, at 3 footnotes omitted).    31 See Seidl, supra note 8, at 88-89.    32 Id. at 90-95. Seidl cites four characteristics as important to the loanshark's success:secrecy of the transaction, informality, speed and convenience, and regular availability of funds. Id. See also Furstenberg, supra note 17, at 925-26: "Usury is a crime, but there are thousands of Americans-businessmen, consumers, gamblers-who need short-term creditwithout reference, collateral, or questions.... As long as Americans enact their consciencesand live their tastes organized crime will be needed."<pagebreak>                              CORNELL LAW REVIEW                               [Vol. 65:127        other sources for money. They mostly figure that the only time        you can get a bank to loan you money is when you can prove        you don't need it.aS Ironically, usury laws are commonly justified as useful weapons in the fight against illicit lending.3 4 While the desirability of usury laws depends on more than their causal relation to criminal activ- ity, 35 there can be little doubt that they help create the market the loanshark supplies. 6        Rates charged by loansharks vary considerably- from less than 52% to more than 1000% per year. 7 The absence of a well-defined market in which supply and demand functions can be reasonably ascertained partially explains this wide variation. The credit market is composed of submarkets, each defined by the status of the borrower-his ability to repay, his planned use for the money, and assorted other variables. Furthermore, the des- peration of the loanshark's customers and their inability to obtain legal credit make the demand for illicit funds highly inelastic. Loansharks thus have a substantial range within which to set their prices.        Other, more subtle factors may also influence loanshark in- terest rates. For example, territorial allocations or spheres of in- fluence within certain industries often give the loanshark a quasi-monopolistic position.3 8 Consequently, variations in loan- shark interest rates may result from price discrimination facili- tated by localized monopolies. In addition, interest assessments may reflect goals other than mere monetary return on invest- ments.

The History of Loansharking       1. Early History of Interest Assessments       Since the earliest codes of the ancient Babylonians, lawmakershave imposed interest ceilings 39 in an attempt to protect debtorsfrom overbearing moneylenders.40 Although the Old Testamentprohibited the charging of interest, 4 1 the New Testamentapparently condoned the practice at a commercial level. 42 TheGreeks allowed the charging of interest despite Aristotle's protes-    3' The terms "interest" and "usury" have not always had their modern meanings.       In Roman law, interest (id quod interest) meant the compensation for damage or       loss suffered by the creditor resulting from the debtor's failure to return the       loan (itself gratuitous in principle) at the date specified by the contract. This       payment of compensation might be agreed upon in the original contract or be       made the subject of a lawful claim after the contract had expired. Such was the       usage until the close of the Middle Ages. "Usury" (Latin usura sometimes also       called foenus and in Greek tokos, i.e., "issue" or "produce" after Aristotle's des-       ignation of "breed of barren metal"), on the other hand, signified a payment       for the "use" of money itself. In its broader sense, "usury" included a charge       for the loan of any good that fell within the class of mutuum, i.e., a loan of a       consumption or "fungible" good. But as a loan of money was classified as a      mutuum, and in practice became the most common form of this type of loan,       the term generally expressed in popular usage its narrower signification of a       charge for the use of money. Only after the repeal of the prohibitions of in-       terest (i.e., of "usury" in the above sense) and the establishment of a legal rate,       did "usury" receive its present meaning of an exorbitant charge for a money       loan or a charge that exceeds the legal rate. Meanwhile the former usage has       been superseded by an extension of the original concept of "interest" which       now means a price for the loan of money (or of any present goods) or a pre-       mium or deviation from par of the price of present money in terms of future       money.T. DIVINE, INTEREST 3-4 (1959). In the text above, the term "interest" is used in its modernsense. In order to avoid confusion, the term "usury" is not used in this section until itsmeaning (in the "excessive interest" sense) is clear.   40 J.

As loans became less personal and began to be viewed as crucial to the advance- ment of trade, toleration of interest assessments increased.

Loansharking in America       Loansharking in the United States has gone through three distinct stages.5 7 Although the types of loansharking activities characterizing each period shade into one another, this break- down reflects logical distinctions and historical reality. The three- stage breakdown also corresponds with the three most significant efforts to explore and control loansharking activity in the United States: the Russell Sage Foundation's investigatory and reform ef- forts from 1905 to 1915; the pre-World War II prosecution of New York loansharks by Thomas E. Dewey; and the investigatoryefforts of congressional and state committees as well as a presi-dential task force during the early 1960's.58 At each of thesejunctures, loansharking in the United States had a differentcharacter.       a. The Post-Civil War Period: The Salary Lender. Following the Civil War, the forces of industrialization, urbanization, and im- migration changed the face of the American economy. With this transition came an unprecedented demand for credit. Consumersas well as businessmen fueled this demand, .seeking credit for purposes other than investment.       Against this backdrop of increased demand, two forcescatalyzed the development of loansharking in America. First,longstanding religious and social beliefs continued to condemnconsumer borrowing as immoral or indicative of the borrower's    -" Skeptics included Bentham, Turgot and Hume. See T.

The market re- sponded to this unsatisfied demand with "salary lending," a newcredit device that prospered from about 1880 through 1915.62Unlike modern day loansharks, who run patently illegal, covertbusinesses, salary lenders operated on the fringe of the law andoften advertised in urban newspapers.6 3 Salary lenders screenedtheir customers carefully, requiring references and employing de-                                                           6tailed application and agreement forms4.                        They relied on legalartifices and bargaining superiority rather than the loanshark'sstrong-arm tactics to exploit their customers. To avert the reachof state usury laws, salary lenders often structured transactions as"purchases" of a portion of the borrower's future salary-thus thename "salary lending." 65 In addition, lenders often requiredwage assignments from "guarantors," usually friends or relatives                        66of the borrower.       Once in the salary lender's net, the borrower rarely escaped.Salary lenders, like contemporary loansharks, relied heavily onfear to ensure collection of debts. But unlike modern loansharks,salary lenders rested their threats on legal consequences, not phys-ical violence. Salary lenders would threaten to sue for breach ofcontract, to garnish the debtor's wages, or to simply contact thedebtor's employer.6 7 Such threats impressed upon the haplessdebtor the disastrous specter of losing his job; employers-solicitous of their employees' moral standing, averse to the ex-pense and risks of handling wage assignments, and fearful of po-    59 Haller & Alviti, supra note 57, at 127.    60 For a discussion of usury statutes in each of the states in the 1800's, see J.

First, the quasi-legal nature of salary-loantransactions and the seeming propriety of salary-lender operationsimpressed the debtor with the sense of a legal and moral obliga-tion to repay. 69 Second, despite the dubious legality of their en-terprise, salary lenders could 'frequently invoke judicial processeswith success.7 0 Finally, salary lenders frequently provided debtorswith refinancings or extensions rather than demanding immediatepayment upon default. 71 Imposition of hefty penalties, accumu-lation of interest into principal, and "chain debts" whereby thedebtor continued to pay interest with little hope of retiring theprincipal commonly entangled short-term borrowers in long-term                 7obligations. 1       Reform efforts aimed at salary lending-largely the productof the Russell Sage Foundation-commenced at the beginning of    68  See Hailer & Alviti, supra note 57, at 134: "[Tlhe borrower's chief fear, quite often, was that an attempt by the lender to enforce the wage assignment would cause the employer to fire him ... " But see Birkhead, supra note 67, at 83: "Few employers, how- ever, will knowingly aid an outlaw lender. When an anti-loan shark campaign exposes the money-lending racket preying on working people, almost all companies give whole-hearted support to the drive and help the oppressed employees every way they can."    '9 Hailer & Alviti, supra note 57, at 134.    71 Much of the success of the salary lender in court resulted from the advantages       that he wielded as a legal adversary. The lender produced complicated forms       signed by the borrower; he often had a power of attorney, so that he could       appear for the borrower and confess judgment; and the borrower, already un-       able to make payments on a small loan, was seldom able to hire an attorney.       Indeed, in those few cases in which a borrower had legal representation, the       lender would normally withdraw the suit and negotiate a settlement. Secondly,       the success of salary lenders reflected the structure of the lower courts, which       were staffed by justices of the peace or magistrates who seldom had legal train-       ing and whose incomes derived from fees for handling cases. Justices who       found for salary lenders could often attract a good deal of business and thus       earn tidy sums, so that it was in the economic interest of justices to look with       favor upon suits by lenders. Hence, salary lenders, as regular and experienced       users of the courts, often enforced illegal contracts against their customers who,       as inexperienced and unrepresented defendants, were unable effectively to as-       sert their legal rights.Id. at 134-35.    71 "However high its rates of charge, the loan-shark business would not have created so much distress if borrowers had been able to pay off their loans when due.

Massachusetts adopted thefirst such act in 1911. New York passed a comprehensive bill in1915, and Illinois followed suit three years later. By 1933, amajority of states had adopted legislation requiring licensing ofsmall lenders, proscribing charges exceeding stated interest, andraising the legal ceiling           on small loans, commonly to a monthly                            74rate    of  3    percent.       Passage of small loan acts sounded the death knell of salarylending. As reformers predicted, such laws generated new andlegal sources of consumer credit; credit unions, savings banks,fraternal organizations, and commercial banks soon sought tosatisfy consumer credit demand.7 5 But not withstanding the bestefforts of reformers, adoption of small loan acts contributed to adisastrous development: the entry of organized crime into the il-licit credit business. 6       b. 1915-1935: Organized Crime and Consumer Credit. Small loanacts eliminated salary lending. No longer could salary lenders relyon the legal ambiguities that previously had lent them credence.Public opinion now held them in disfavor, and heightened penal-ties for illegal extensions of credit deterred brushes with thenewly extended reach of the law. The lending institutions    7'  The Russell Sage Foundation undertook extensive studies of the loansharking prob-lem and drafted a model small loan law to encourage passage of such laws in the states.

Kaplan & D. Kessler eds. 1976).    76 There are indications that some variation of organized crime was involved with earlyloansharking activities prior to the adoption of small loan acts. See F. IANNI, supra note 14,at 66. For example, Guiseppe, an immigrant from Sicily, set up a "bank" in his home inNew York's lower East Side, and lent money to neighbors.       No one talks directly about what occurred when someone defaulted, but there       are suggestions that Guiseppe was tied in with one of the Sicilian Black Hand       gangs, and those unfortunate immigrants who were unwilling to repay him       would themselves be repaid with physical violence and in some cases even       death.Id. See also H. NELLI, THE BUSINESS OF CRIME 110 (1976).<pagebreak> 1980]                            LOANSHARKING spawned by the small loan acts, however, only partially filled the void created by the elimination of the salary lenders. One factor accounting for this result was that the fixed costs of making any loan-such as labor costs associated with investigation and collection-were approximately the same regardless of the size of the loan. Thus, the smaller the loan, the higher the ratio of fixed costs to principal lent.7 7 Because small loan acts precluded lend- ers from compensating for these disproportionate costs by charg- ing service fees or profitable interest rates, legitimate credit                                                                                   78 sources often found it unprofitable to make small loans.        Thus, even after enactment of small loan legislation, large numbers of consumer borrowers remained without access tocredit. Above-board lenders restricted consumer credit to "a newly-created, somewhat more affluent class of borrowers whodesired larger loans and had the financial stability to make re-payments. . . . Because the needs of small borrowers were often unmet by legal lenders," the demand for small loans remained un-satisfied in major cities.7 9 This unmet demand gave rise to abreed of creditor wholly unlike the salary lender. No longer didillicit lending wear the trappings of legality. Nor did openness andthreats of mere legal sanctions characterize consumer lending.Loansharking became the province of organized crime, and fearof physical reprisals for nonpayment became its predominant fea-ture.8 0 In response to this development, then-special prosecutorThomas E. Dewey initiated a wave of prosecutions in 1935 aimedat racketeers providing illegal credit-and often bloody    77 North & Miller, supra note 36, at 195.    7' Hailer & Alviti, supra note 57, at 140. Loansharks quickly stepped into this gap. "Noloan seems to have been too small for Guiseppe's consideration in the early days; oneinformant reports that he always borrowed $2.00 from Guiseppe on Wednesdays and re-paid $2.50 on Saturdays. Some loans were as low as fifty cents in the days before 1920."

See Note, supra note 20, at 103.    80 Thomas Dewey described the violence used by the new breed of loansharks:           The loan sharks organized their racket into a big business. The gangsters       broke heads and cut men with knives and made their victims lose their jobs....              [A] man had paid $40 on a $20 loan and was still $8.00 behind in the       payments. The loan shark walked right into the apartment with two thugs.

Post-1935: The Maturation of Organized Loansharking. Loan-sharking in the early 1930's was characterized by large-scale illicitconsumer lending. Once established, however, consumer-orientedloansharking enterprises expanded into new markets. Althoughhistorians have documented incidents of underworld loans tolegitimate businesses and criminal borrowers as early as the 1920's,"' a marked expansion in this area occurred during the nextdecade. The repeal of prohibition in 1933 and the proliferation ofgambling and narcotics trafficking increased the pool of capitaland personnel available for carrying on the loansharking activitiesof organized crime.8 3 Furthermore, the Depression caused botha scarcity of capital for legal loans and a staggering demand for                                                                                     8 4credit, particularly among undercapitalized small businesses.       These factors allowed organized crime to make substantial in-roads into markets other than consumer credit. Most importantly,racketeer loansharks began pouring cash into legitimatebusinesses. The growing gambling industry also produced twosignificant new groups of customers: unlucky (or unskilled) bet-tors and bet-takers.8s             Syndicate members thus began lending to        Dewey's own account is informative:            In our first sudden swoop, in a field nobody knew we were even looking       into, our rackets investigation arrested twenty-two loan sharks in New York       City. We held them on 252 counts in 126 meticulously prepared indictments.            With the cases parceled out among several deputy assistants, we brought       the loan sharks to trial one by one. Within a month they had all been convicted,       save one who escaped on a minor technical mistake .... During the trials, more       complaints were brought in against more loan sharks, and we went out and       made more arrests.

By the 1950's sub- stantial loansharking operations existed in numerous American cities.8 6 In 1964 one state investigatory commission concluded that loansharking had become "a major and most lucrative opera- tion of the criminal underworld," 87 and three years later a presi- dential commission estimated the volume of the loanshark busi- ness to be in the "multi-billion dollar range." 88 D. Loansharking Operations         1. The Transaction        The classic street transaction is the six-for-five loan in which a"steerer" refers a prospective customer to the local loanshark.Bartenders, doormen, cab drivers, and others in daily contact withpotential borrowers receive a small fee for this service.8 9 Theloanshark, upon making the loan, instructs the borrower to returnone week later with six dollars for each five dollars borrowed.        The six-for-five is an example of a "vig" loan, requiring pay-ment of a weekly interest charge, with principal to be repaid in asingle lump sum. The other common type loan, the "knockdown,"involves a specified schedule of repayment, including both interestand principal; a $1,000 loan, for example, might be repaid inthirteen weekly installments of $100.90        As previously noted, interest rates vary widely for both typesof loans. A favorable relationship with the loanshark or a reputa-tion for punctual payments may entitle the borrower to lowerrates. Sizeable loans to businesses or prominent individuals alsobear lower rates, and the loanshark will frequently consider theintended use of the money when assessing interest on substantialloans. 9 '       6 See Seidl, supra note 8, at 62-79.     87 N.Y.

If you don't pay me I'll have to take it with me. Thenthe next day I'll take your other ear. Then we'll start on your fingers." 94        Such graphic expressions provide effective tools for increas-ing the likelihood of repayment.

Nonetheless,        there is nearly unanimous agreement by law enforcement officials and other       experts on the basis of case experience that there has been a distinct decline in       the most serious forms of organized violence-gangland beatings and killings.        In Chicago, where organized crime was probably more violent than in many       other places, there were 765 "gang murders" between 1919 and 1934, an aver-       age of 38 per year. From 1935 to 1967, a period twice as long, there were 229       such murders, an average of seven per year.             The reason for the decline is not that [organized crime] is reducing its       activities-on the contrary, the above observations have indicated that its bases       have broadened and strengthened-but simply that it has changed to more       sophisticated management techniques. Its leaders have learned that violence<pagebreak>                              CORNELL LAW REVIEW                              [Vol. 65:127Rather than inflict serious physical damage, the loanshark prefersto impose financial penalties on the delinquent borrower. 1 1 Byadding missed interest payments to the principal outstanding, theloanshark increases both the regular interest due and the amount                                       02of the loan to be repaid.'         Loansharks can also protect themselves by requiring the equiv- alent of a cosigner for loans to first-time borrowers. Thecosigner is often the individual who introduces the borrower tothe loanshark; he vouches for the borrower and becomes liable tothe loanshark in the event of default. This approach reflects thebusiness-like trend in loansharking techniques. As Joseph Valachistated in describing his loansharking enterprise, "I tried to run it                                                                                 03as a business. I'm not looking to beat up somebody." 1        Occasionally, a loanshark customer unable to meet his obliga-tion is allowed to renegotiate his loan through the device of a"sit-down." Although sit-downs are used primarily to resolve in-trasyndicate disputes,' 1 4 loansharks sometimes direct delinquentoutsiders to this forum to be "let off the hook." 105 In these sit-downs, a syndicate arbitrator establishes a figure for full settle-ment. This figure normally exceeds the initial loan and oftenranges as high as three to four times that amount. 0 6        In lieu of a final settlement at a sit-down, a loanshark whohas stripped the borrower of all resources may agree to "stop theclock." ' By temporarily suspending "vigorish" payments, 10 8 theloanshark allows the borrower to improve his financial position.        only exposes them to public attention and law enforcement pressure. A con-        tinuing effort has been made to avoid violence, and much of the actual force        has been replaced by a system of rational alternatives, which apply to both        external and internal organized violence. 11 CRIMES OF VIOLENCE, supra note 17, at 201-02 (footnote omitted).

The Structure of the Operation        Profits produced by loansharking and other illicit underworld operations provide organized crime with large cash reserves withwhich to finance lending operations. Loansharks, however, mayalso utilize legitimate lending institutions to generate capital."1 'The New York State Commission of Investigation disclosed aracket whereby John "Gentleman Johnny" Massiello used at least$1.5 million from a single branch bank to finance his loanshark- ing operations." 2 Shunned by commercial creditors, a borrowersought a business loan from Massiello. In exchange for a $6,000loan, Massiello demanded a promissory note for $8,000. The notewas taken to the bank, where, with the assistance of a corruptbank officer, the note was discounted at a rate of six percent.Massiello gave $6,000 to the borrower, and pocketed $1,520.Thus Massiello received instant repayment of principal plus agenerous rate of interest; meanwhile, collection was deferred tothe bank. In addition to discounting third-party notes, Massielloand the corrupt loan officer, using dummy corporations and avariety of names, engineered over $750,000 in loans, thus vastly                                                                                       3expanding the capital base of their loansharking enterprise."        Unlike some activities of organized crime, loansharking re-quires no extensive operational organization; nor does it require   1 D. CRESSY, supra note 91, at 84.   110 Organized crime figures in Massachusetts do not appear to believe in "stopping theclock." Charles Rogovin, expert on organized crime for the Massachusetts attorney general,stated:            All other Mafia families have a tradition which they call "stopping the       clock." That is, when you're bled dry, they stop the clock on the interest and       just let you give back the principal. They stop short of killing, on the theory       that a dead man can't pay. But not here. They're totally ruthless about loan-       shark debts.E.

Access to capital generally suffices to operatea loansharking business. Organized crime contacts or affiliations,however, are helpful and frequently necessary to ensure collectionof overdue accounts.       As in almost all sophisticated syndicate crime, the majorfigures who profit from loansharking are well insulated. The bossreceives a substantial return at minimum risk by entrusting moneyto his lieutenants, commonly assessing interest of 1 percent perweek." 4 In larger corporate loans, lieutenants often deal directlywith the ultimate borrower. More often, however, lieutenantsserve only as middlemen, passing money along to soldiers andstreet distributors at 1.5 to 2.5 percent weekly.' 1 5 This "thirdechelon" handles street loans and is free to charge whatever rate                                               16of interest the market will bear.       Each participant in the hierarchy of distribution is an inde-pendent contractor, responsible for full repayment of financial ob-ligations. By lending a boss's money, however, the loansharkbenefits from his superior's backing and position of authority andinfluence should a borrower default or an intrasyndicate disputearise. Such support may evaporate when a syndicate loansharklends his own money and fails to share the profits with his          11 7bosses.      At the lowest levels of loansharking, distributors sometimespress delinquent debtors into soliciting new business as part of  "I See 115 CONG.

Buster would mark it down in his book since he was supposed to get a      percentage of all of Lombardo's business. Now if any of the forty loans went      bad, Lombardo would tell Buster that the bad loans were among the ten he'd      told him about.M. HELLERMAN & T.

These"runners," frequently employed in factories or in service indus- tries, work for the loanshark on a part-time basis. A working mantemporarily in need of cash will seek out the familiar runner. Forhis part in the transaction, the runner receives a small percentageof the profit." 19       Despite the similarities in the organization of their operations,individual loansharks tend to cater to specialized types of clients.While some deal only with legitimate businessmen, others preferoutlaw entrepreneurs. One medium-level loanshark dealt mainlywith fur dealers; another lent funds almost solely to bookmakers.The reasons for this phenomenon probably relate to the loan-shark's connections (persons tend to refer new customers fromtheir own industry), his geographical domain (for example, thewaterfront), and his area of expertise (which facilitates evaluationof credit risks and disposition of collateral).E. Loansharking Customers        1. The Legitimate Individual       Driven from legitimate credit sources as poor risks,respectable members of the community may be compelled to turnto the loanshark. Usually considered a "victim" rather than a "cus-tomer," the individual borrower is often unaware that illicit ac-tivities provide the source of the loanshark's capital. 2 ¡ Similarly,the customer frequently fails to recognize that the extortionate in-terest he surrenders contributes to the capital base supportingfurther illegal operations. 2 '   118 One heavily indebted borrower, Nathan Sackin, agreed to become a "frontman" forhis loanshark, John Sonny Franzese. Sackin recruited Gerald Wolff. When Wolff fell be-hind in his payments, he in turn was forced to recruit new customers for Sackin.

The Legitimate Businessman        Conventional credit markets, with the assistance of the Small Business Administration, serve the financing needs of most of the nation's small businesses. As in the consumer context, however, restrictions on legitimate credit foster loansharking incursions into business markets. Entrepreneurs seeking venture capital and small businessmen in need of operating funds often secure usurious loans by providing as collateral the very businesses they seek to             1 47 advance.        Businesses characterized by chronic cash flow problems are particularly vulnerable to loanshark predation. Garment manufac- turers, for example, produce seasonal fashions well in advance of sales. The volatility of fashions renders the goods unattractive col-lateral for conventional loans. Large orders and incoming ship- ments, however, require significant cash outlays. 148 Cash-shortdealers may not qualify for legitimate loans to cover outstandingchecks, and even creditworthy merchants may be hampered bytime constraints. Rather than ruin relationships with suppliers andlegitimate creditors, the merchant turns to the loanshark to obtainnecessary working capital. 1 49 When the merchant sells his newlypurchased goods, his revenues amply cover the principal and in-terest. Fashion trends or business fluctuations, however, maydelay disposal of merchandise and prevent timely repayment.Scissored by exorbitant interest rates and an inability to move hismerchandise, the overextended businessman may become an un-willing partner of the loanshark.        Regardless of his creditworthiness, any businessman may oc-casionally meet with unexpected but urgent capital demands. Thebusinessman may therefore seek short-term funding from theloanshark while arranging for long-term legitimate financing. Inone case, a manufacturer of double knit clothing had purchasedeight machines for $128,000. The seller provided temporaryfinancing, taking notes payable on demand. The double knitbusiness prospered, but the manufacturer, scrambling to meet or-    '47"[Firequently the loanshark is the only available source of a needed loan.

The seller, probably contacted by a potential buyer, demanded immediate payment of the notes or return of the machines. The manufacturer, an honest businessman desperately in need of $80,000, faced two unpleasant alternatives: employ the services of a loanshark or submit to the ruination of his business. Charging five percent weekly interest, the loanshark was expensive. In two weeks, however, the man- ufacturer secured legitimate bank financing and eliminated his diebt. He was fortunate; his gamble culminated in the satisfaction of all parties and only cost him $8,000.15¡        The susceptibility of businesses to loansharks, however, is not confined to companies confronting cash-flow difficulties. Personal loans to owners, officers, or key employees may provide the step- ping stone for infiltration of legitimate enterprises. Money bor- rowed from loansharks by businessmen for personal reasons such as gambling debts or hospital bills can precipitate business disas- ter.F. Loanshark Infiltration of Businesses       The syndicate dabbles in a wide range of businesses.' 51 In 1951, the Kefauver Committee of the United States Senate iden-tified approximately fifty industries infiltrated by organizedcrime. 1 52 This list runs the gamut of American businesses-among them manufacturing, services, finance, entertainment, andmedia. The business affiliations of criminals attending the 1957meeting at the Apalachin estate of underworld figure Joseph Bar-bara illustrate the scope of legitimate business infiltration. Ninemen present operated coin-machine businesses; sixteen were inthe garment industry; ten owned grocery stores; seventeen ranbars or restaurants; eleven were in the olive oil and cheese im-porting business; nine were in the construction business; othersheld interests in automobile agencies, coal companies, entertain-   is0 JOEY,  supra note 91, at 91-92.      For three brothers in business together, financial obligations to a loanshark proved lesssatisfactory. After borrowing $165,000 from a loanshark for a business venture, they al-lowed the interest to accumulate. Within a year, having paid $163,000 in principal andinterest, the brothers still owed $124,000. After kidnapping two of the brothers, the loan-shark demanded and received an additional promissory note for $140,000. Small BusinessHearings, supra note 4, at 114-19 (statement of Robert J.

Law enforcement officials agree that entry into legitimate business is con- tinually increasing and that it has not decreased organized crime's control over gambling, usury and other profitable, low-risk criminal enterprises." See TASK FORCE REPORT: ORGANIZED CRIME, supra note 15, at 5 (footnote omitted). Loansharking also provides a vehicle for taking over small independent criminal ventures. Id. at 3 n.33.    155 Grutzner, supra note 23, at 49.       While this Article focuses on extortionate and usurious credit transactions, loanshark- ing is only one tool employed by organized crime to penetrate the business community. See Woetzel, An Overview of Organized Crime: Mores versus Morality, 347 ANNALS 1, 6-7 (1963);see also Peterson, Chicago: Shades of Capone, 347 ANNALS 30, 32-39 (1963). The syndicate hasinfiltrated the marketplace through legitimate purchases of ongoing businesses, althoughless amicable tactics are usually employed. Regardless of the technique used, the businesses targeted for infiltration invariably possess one or more of the following characteristics:              (1) Unorganized, inaccurate bookkeeping and records. Using embezzle-        ment, theft, and pilferage, employees connected with organized crime can        siphon off business assets. Stock brokerage houses, plagued by internal security        problems, often fall into this category. W. MULLAN, THE THEFT AND DIS-        POSITION OF SECURITIES BY ORGANIZED CRIME 24 (1975).              (2) Inventory or cash control difficulties. These problems typically occur        in businesses like discotheques, restaurants and bars, and facilitate "skimming"        of profits through pilferage and fraud. Furstenberg, supra note 17, at 917.              (3) Dependence upon a single supplier. By establishing localized        monopolies, the syndicate forces businessmen to turn to it to obtain products        otherwise unobtainable. This leverage is then employed gradually to take over        the business.              (4) Dealings with powerful unions. By dominating local unions, syndicates        can force profitable concessions from businesses forced to deal with unions but        eager to avoid labor problems. For example, Terry and Gene Catena, owners of        the Best Sales Company, attempted to market detergent to the Great Atlantic        and Pacific Tea Company. The expected commissions for the transaction to-        taled $1.5 million over ten years. "Sales agents" Joe Pecora and Irving Kaplan        negotiated for Best Sales. Pecora, an organized crime figure, was the boss of        Teamster Local 863; Kaplan headed Amalgamated Meat Cutter's Local 464 and        supervised contracts with A&P. Kaplan advised A&P officials that the upcoming        renegotiation of the meat cutters' contract might be hindered if the detergent        were not purchased. Pecora asserted that Teamsters would not cross meat cut-        ters' picket lines. Melvin, Mafia War on the A&P, Readers Digest, July, 1970, at        71-76.              (5) Substantial credit buying. Businesses that normally carry large accounts        payable provide excellent vehicles for bankruptcy schemes and other frauds.

Methods of Loanshark Infiltration         Using ostensibly legitimate means, the loanshark may simply assume ownership of a business in satisfaction of the owner's debt. 15 6 For example, Joseph Valachi, in need of a tax cover toexplain his affluent lifestyle, entered the dress manufacturing in-dustry. A Bronx factory owner, a regular customer of Valachi'sloansharking operation, was delinquent in his weekly payments.Valachi supplied additional investment capital and labor "counsel-ing" 15' and cancelled the manufacturer's debt in return for full                               158partnership status.         The loanshark can also infiltrate a business through strategicplacement of a confederate.' 5 9 In the million-dollar MurrayPacking "bust-out," 160 Joseph Pagano played this role for a highranking syndicate member.         In other cases, loansharks infiltrate businesses secretly. Anemployee of a "target" business may steal company property orsurreptitiously provide company services to satisfy his obligationto the loanshark. 1 6 1 Inadequately protected secu'rities kept in       generally N.Y.

Hotels, bars, nightclubs, and small store-       fronts facilitate a variety of organized crime activities. Central locations and       numerous patrons make these facilities well-suited for gambling, loansharking,       and narcotics operations. See K.

Purposes of Syndicate Infiltration of Businesses       The syndicate has numerous reasons for infiltrating legiti-mate businesses. The four most common are: (a) establishing a"front" to conceal illicit activities, (b) obtaining specific services orconcessions from employees or other insiders, (c) "busting out"the business to profit at the expense of company creditors, and                                                                                69(d) "skimming" pre-tax dollars from company profits.       a. Operating a "Front." Frequently the loanshark will continuethe legitimate operations of an infiltrated business as a "front" forillegitimate activities. By maintaining an interest in a legitimate en-terprise, the loanshark generates a legal income to display to theInternal Revenue Service. 170 Should the IRS question bank ac-counts or expensive living habits, the loanshark can point to hisownership of or employment by a legitimate company. Moreover,a "legitimate" company with unfair competitive advantages, suchas control of well-placed labor officials 17 or access to stolen prop-   168 Id.   1'9 Of course, infiltrators may simply run the business for profit. Such entrepreneurialmoves are often accompanied by the use of extortion to create a monopoly and reapoligopolistic profits. "When organized crime moves into a business, it usually brings to thatventure all the techniques of violence and intimidation which it used in its illegalbusinesses." 115 CONG REc. 5874 (1969) (remarks of Sen. McClellan).   170 See generally R.A. Nossen, The Seventh Basic Investigation Technique, Analyzing FinancialTransactions in the Investigation of Organized and White-Collar Crimes, in LAW ENFORCEMENTASSISTANCE ADMINISTRATION,        DEP'T OF JUSTICE, THE INVESTIGATION OF WHITE COLLARCRIME app. D (1977).   "'  Access to the right person may prove extremely beneficial to a businessman. Forexample, in 1970, the T.W. Bateson Company, a general contractor, hired members ofUnion Local 210 of the International Hod Carriers, Building, and Common Laborers ofAmerica to construct a federal office building in Buffalo, New York. Labor problems<pagebreak>1980]                              LOANSHARKINGerty for inventory,' 7 2 may prove highly profitable in and of itself.       The operation of legitimate businesses can conceal illegality inother ways. Loansharks and other racketeers can use thesebusinesses to launder illegally obtained cash. Similarly, by servingas highly paid "consultants" to these businesses, they can collectloansharked debts or receive extorted payments with ostensible                1 73legitimacy.       Contact with a legitimate business also creates an air of re-spectability for the organized crime figure. After acquiring theLido, a fashionable restaurant, Joseph Valachi said, "As far as theneighbors are concerned, I was always a gentleman ...Mildred[Valachi's wife] told them that I had the Lido, so they figured Iwas just a guy who ran a restaurant." 174 More importantly, alegitimate business gives the racketeer a place to hang his hat anda reason for engaging in otherwise suspect activities. As a "front,"any business provides the loanshark with an office to conduct hisillicit operations, a secure location to hold meetings, and anexplanation for contacts with businessmen, other criminals, or                       75public officials.      b. Obtaining Services and Concessions. Small-scale infiltrationscan also generate large-scale profits for the loanshark. Such ar-rangements usually involve neither racketeer ownership norracketeer control; rather, the legitimate businessman grants spe-plagued the construction; absenteeism, padded payrolls, pilferage, timeclock cheating andslow work were rampant. Bateson's efforts to resolve the problems resulted in labor walk-outs, threats of violence and a mysterious on-site fire. At the suggestion of union members,Bateson hired John Cammillieri, a reputed "capo" in Buffalo's Magadino crime family.Cammillieri was paid $7.10 an hour for his assistance as a "job coordinator." Almost im-mediately, the laborers resumed work with greater efficiency than even the Bateson offi-cials had anticipated. TIME, Aug. 30, 1971, at 21.   272 "Hijacking is big business for the mob. Most of the hijack loads, whether it'scigarettes, liquor, furs, appliances, or food, are shipped by the mob to discount stores theyown or have connections with." V. TERESA, supra note 161, at 137.   173 One indebted restaurant owner was required to "employ" SGS Associates, a laborrelations firm fronting for Carlo Gambino. Despite the absence of any labor problems, theowner paid $1,000 a month for this service. Small Business Hearings,supra note 4, at 48-49(statement of Michael H. Metzger, Asst. Dist. Atty., N.Y.

The luncheonette,started by a middle-aged couple in 1960, prospered until a nearby construction project costthe owners a substantial part of their trade. The proprietors, desperately in need of work-ing capital, borrowed from a local loanshark at rates of up to twenty-five percent interestper week. The couple's debt was taken over by a syndicate lieutenant who was expandinghis bookmaking and loansharking activities in the area. Predictably, this new creditor beganto use the luncheonette as a front for his bookmaking and loansharking business, forcingthe proprietors to handle bets. N.Y.

A Louisianaman loaned money to restaurant and tavern owners, who in turnaccepted cigarette machines, jukeboxes, and pinball machinesfrom a syndicate supplier.177 The owner of a warehouse deeplyin debt to a loanshark, allowed the shark to use his facility to storehijacked trucks and merchandise.'7 8 A Philadelphia restaurantowner, in debt to a loanshark, explained why he bought a particu-lar product: "If I bought another brand,                       my restaurant would be                                                      9a parking        lot  tomorrow      morning."       11       c. "Busting Out" a Legitimate Business. Syndicates will some-times infiltrate a business intending to pirate the company's assetsand force it into bankruptcy. Such schemes to defraud companycreditors are known as "bust-outs" or "scams." Loansharking oftenprovides the requisite toehold for initiating a "bust-out." 180       The procedure is well illustrated by the Murray Packingscandal. 8 ' Murray Packing supplied meat, poultry, and eggs toNew York area supermarkets. The company had purchased goods    176 It has transferred to the legitimate field of business the same strong-arm prac-        tices which have proved so successful in the past. A manufacturer who will not        use a syndicate-owned trucking firm finds his life in danger or his family        threatened.

Within a year of its incorporation, the business stood on the brink of bankruptcy. A salesman for Murray Packing, Joseph Pagano, 8" promising a solu- tion to the company's financial problem, steered the company's managers to an alleged lieutenant in New York's Gambino family,                                         18 3 a man named Castellana.         To "save" the faltering company, Murray's principals took an $8,500 loan from Castellana. The one-percent weekly interest rate, although modest by loansharking standards, nonetheless proved unduly burdensome for the cash-strapped company. Un- able to meet their financial obligations to either Castellana or other creditors, Murray's managers acceded to an imposed settle- ment. Pagano became one-third owner and president of the com- pany and received authority to write checks and transact company business. During January, February, and March of 1961, Murray Packing reestablished its credit by paying suppliers promptly. The company then drastically increased its meat and poultry credit purchases. These supplies were promptly transferred to Pride Wholesale Meat and Poultry Co., a concern owned by Castellana. The sales to Pride Wholesale, however, were below cost. Further- more, as revenues entered the Murray Packing account, Pagano withdrew them-issuing personal notes to the company.        In May, 1961, Murray Packing was adjudicated bankrupt.The company's liabilities totaled approximately $1,300,000, repre-senting debts to 85 creditors. Assets amounted to $1,060,422, in-cluding $750,000 in promissory notes from Joseph Pagano.Pagano and Castellana-as well as principals in the originalbusiness-were convicted of conspiracy to violate bankruptcy         84laws. 1        The Murray Packing "bust out" illustrates the perils to thesmall businessman of taking usurious loans.

Skimming Company Profits. Organized crime figures will fre-quently permit a controlled business to operate and use shamtransactions to "skim off" its income or assets. Commonly, suchschemes presage a bust-out although some involve more limitedincursions. A syndicate figure who has gained control of a busi-ness may put himself on the payroll or bill the company for phan-tom services or supplies.' 8 6 Such payments provide the syndicatemember with a steady flow of income and the business with taxdeductions. In some cases, a controlled company instead of sup-plying cash may channel its products to the loanshark's designees                                                                  87for nonexistent or inadequate consideration.1       A classic "skim off" involved the Progressive Drug Com-pany.18 8 Pawnee Drug Company purchased Progressive, a legiti-mate family enterprise.

The new ownership quickly switched the company's   185 Even if loansharking does not provide the initial entry in a bust-out, it may proveuseful in consummating the fraud. In the case of the Falcone Dairy, for example, loan-sharking supplied the means for disposing of "skimmed off" products.     Joseph and Vincent Falcone, known Mafia members, operated Falcone Dairy Products,a wholesale distributor of soft cheeses in Brooklyn. In 1967, the Falcones and Joseph Cur-reri opened a soft cheese factory in Alburg, Vermont. The Alburg factory purchased milkfrom Vermont farmers and shipped its products to Falcone Dairy. The farmers' coopera-tives billed Alburg directly for milk, and Alburg billed Falcone for cheese. By 1973, Alburgowed $500,000 to the dairy cooperatives. Shortly after the farmers demanded payment, theAlburg plant burned and the corporation entered bankruptcy proceedings.      Alburg had made shipments to Falcone Dairy valued at approximately $1,600,000 peryear. Most of these shipments had never been paid for, however. When the creditors de-manded payment, Falcone asserted that 400,000 pounds of the purchased cheese had beenrancid. Falcone claimed damages of an amount in excess of the purchase price due.      The scam succeeded because Falcone was able to dispose of the "rancid" cheese with-out showing a sale on its books. The loansharking operations of the syndicate facilitatedthis process. Illegal aliens, using loanshark funds, had established pizza parlors in NewYork and New Jersey. The loansharks collected their debt by selling the "rancid" cheese tothe aliens at exorbitant prices.

Recently enacted laws prohibit extortionatelending and collection practices. Other provisions seek to reachthe criminal hierarchy that finances and profits from illegal credittransactions. In some states these fresh attempts to control theloanshark complement long-enforced criminal usury and extor-tion statutes. Where in force together, these provisions are well-adapted to the practical difficulties involved in prosecuting thewide variety of illicit lending activities.A. Extortionate Credit Transaction Laws       1.

State courts have had no chanceto examine state ECT provisions closely. However, the federal andstate ECT statutes are strikingly similar. This fact, coupled withthe federal provision's progenitor role, renders federal authoritieshighly relevant in deciphering the meaning of state ECT laws.        2. Elements of the Offense        Courts that have analyzed the federal ECT statute have iden-tified three elements of the crime it defines: (1) making an exten-sion of credit, (2) with the requisite extortionate understanding,while (3) acting intentionally and knowingly.' 9 7 Although the stat-   192  15 U.S.C. ¤ 1601-1691 and 18 U.S.C. 33 891-894, 896 (1976).   ,93 See, e.g., AiZ REV STAT.

Conduct. All ECT laws established a conduct requirementof making an extension of credit. The federal definition is typical:"To extend credit means to make or renew any loan, or to enterinto any agreement, tacit or express, whereby the repayment orsatisfaction of debt or claim, whether acknowledged or disputed,valid or invalid, and however arising, may or will be deferred." 199        Courts have read the words "any loan ...valid or invalid ...however arising," to cover atypical loans.2 00 For example, gam-bling debts are included, 20 1 as are obligations arising from unau-thorized use of credit cards 202 or the misappropriation of partner-ship funds.2 0 3 In United States v. Bufalino,20 4 the Second Circuitheld that an "extension of credit" arose 20 5 when the "victim," aswindler, obtained $25,000 worth of diamonds "in exchange for aseries of promises and a worthless check." 20 6 In the court's opin-ion, "Congress took an exceedingly broad view of what it is 'toextend credit,'"207 So that even illicit transactions would comewithin the reach of the statute.        An even broader reading of the statute appears in UnitedStates v. Totaro, 20 8 where the loan proceeds were never trans-ferred:        There is no doubt that [the defendants] entered into an agree-        ment to make the extortionate loan of $2500. Although the        loan may have been invalid because the check was not paid,        nevertheless the credit agreement was entered into. We think that is        all the statute requires, and that when the agreement was made    151 See, e.g., United States v. Keresty, 465 F.2d 36, 40-41 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 991 (1972).    19918 U.S.C. ¤ 891(1) (1976).

The Creditor's Understanding. The ECT laws require proofthat there was an "understanding of the creditor and debtor at thetime [they entered into the loan] ... that delay in making repay-ment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of vio-lence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, repu-tation, or property of any person." 210 To determine whether thisunderstanding was present, a court must examine the state ofmind of both parties when they entered into the transaction. 2 1 'The primary difficulty with the statute rests in this inquiry.       Because the required understanding primarily involves thepossibility of violence or physical harm to the defaulting debtor,proof of the creditor's manifestation of this element would typi-cally consist of threats made to the alleged debtor. Congress didnot use the term "threat," however, although most traditional ex-tortion statutes specifically require proof of threats.2 12 By requir-ing only an understanding of possible harmful consequences,Congress attempted to spare prosecutors the potentially difficulttask of proving that the defendant explicitly threatened thedebtor. The Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purpose in-dicate that the statute is aimed at transactions which are charac-                                                                                     21 3terized by the use of implicit or explicit threats of violence.Congress thus recognized that loansharks do not always openlythreaten their victims, but often operate on the basis of implica-tion and veiled suggestion.       Courts have also recognized that the understanding elementrequires proof of something less than full-blown threats. In UnitedStates v. Annoreno, 2 1 4 for example, the defendants argued thatsince no government witnesses had testified as to express threats,there could be no conviction. The court's response was direct:"Clearly, Congress could not have intended to punish only those   209 Id. at 959 (emphasis added).  210   18 U.S.C. ¤ 891(6) (1976) (emphasis added).   211 See, e.g., United States v.

On the contrary, the inquiry should be whether the record       as a whole discloses a reasonable basis upon which the borrowers       might have predicated their fear that default or delinquency                                                                           216       might result in harm to themselves or their families.       Special evidentiary provisions in the federal ECT statutefurther support this view of the understanding requirement. Inmaking out a prima facie case of an extortionate transaction, theprosecutor can rely on specified kinds of circumstantial evi-dence,21 7 none of which necessarily lead to the inference thatopen threats were used.       Courts have effectuated this congressional extension of thereach of anti-loansharking laws by defining understanding as a"meeting of the minds" between the two parties. The prosecutoris not required to show that the defendant and his victim ex-                                                                                         218pressly agreed that violent consequences would follow default;the proof need only consist of evidence that the parties com-prehended 219 or were aware 2 20 that violent collection tacticswould be used.       c. The Debtor's Understanding. Proof that the debtor feared vio-lent or criminal retaliation would tend to show the required un-derstanding on his part.

The important element is thus not fear, but only an awareness that the                                                                               223 transaction was backed by implicit threats of violence.        d. State of Mind. Perhaps because the understanding elementrequires a subjective inquiry, the ECT statute fails to specify astate-of-mind requirement. Courts interpreting the federal provi-sion, however, have held that the defendant must act "intention-ally and knowingly." 22 4 In United States v. Nakaladski,22 5 an ECTconspiracy case, the court fleshed out this standard: "[T]he gov-ernment [must] prove only that [the] appellants had planned andintended that [the debtor] would understand the possibility thatharmful consequences could [follow]." 2 26 This broad standard isappropriate, since it includes those who do not actually intend touse force but do intend to convey that possibility to the bor-           2 27rower.   221 Some extortion statutes use the term "fear" as well as the term "threat." See, e.g.,Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. ¤ 1951(b)(2) (1976); CAL. PENAL CODE ¤¤ 518, 519 (West 1970);IDAHO CODE ¤¤ 18-2801, 18-2802 (1979); MISS. CODE ANN. ¤ 97-3-77 (1972).   222 United States v. Annoreno, 460 F.2d 1303, 1309 (7th Cir.) (emphasis added), cert.denied, 409 U.S. 852 (1972). The defendants in Annoreno were convicted only of conspiracyto violate the ECT statute. Id. at 1305. Therefore, the understanding of the victims was notstrictly at issue, and the court's statement could be considered dictum. The court felt com-pelled to consider the nature of the debtor's understanding, however, since it required thegovernment to prove "that the defendants planned and intended that those to whom theyextended credit would understand the possible harmful consequences of default or delin-quency." Id. at 1309 n.7.   221 See United States v. Benedetto, 558 F.2d 171, 178 (3d Cir. 1977).      The absence of a fear requirement eliminates a potential prosecutorial problem if itsonly witness is a government agent who posed as a borrower. The agent could fully under-stand that nonrepayment could result in violence, but experience no fear because he knowsthe lender will be arrested. Cf United States v. Quinn, 514 F.2d 1250, 1267 (5th Cir.1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 955 (1976) (prosecution under Hobbs Act, federal extortionstatute, 18 U.S.C. ¤ 1951 (1976)).   224 United States v. Benedetto, 558 F.2d 171, 177 (3d Cir. 1977).   225 481 F.2d 289 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1064 (1973).   226 Id. at 297.   227 The standard is arguably overbroad, however, since it would also take in the blufferwho plans and intends to create the required understanding, but has no intention of actu-ally harming the borrower upon default. On these facts, the lender arguably has no "un-derstanding" that illegal collection tactics "could result." See 18 U.S.C. ¤ 891(6) (1976).      The phrase "understanding of the creditor and the debtor" (id.) should cover the bluf-fer, however, for three reasons. First, this construction is compatible with the statute's gen-eral purpose of eradicating loans consummated against a backdrop of violence.

Historical Development and Basic Principles        Most ECT jurisdictions have complemented extortionate lend- ing provisions with companion laws prohibiting the collection of                                                                                          2 29debts 228 by extortionate means (hereinafter, collection laws).Such a provision first appeared in Title II of the federal Con-sumer Credit Code of 1968: 230       Whoever knowingly participates in any way, or conspires to do       so, in the use of any extortionate means            (1) to collect or attempt to collect any extension of credit,       or            (2) to punish any person for the nonrepayment thereof,       shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more                                    23       than 20 years, or both. 'A few states have since passed similar statutes. 23 2 While the ECTlaw focuses on circumstances surrounding the extension of credit,"it is the use of extortion in the course of loan collections which is... made unlawful by [the collection law]... ," 233       2. Elements of the Offense       The heart of the collection offense is the use, or threateneduse, of force or violence as a means of collecting money lent. "It isthe effort of usurious money lenders, or 'loan sharks,' to seek ex-212 and accompanying text supra. Whether or not the lender actually intends to use vio-lence, veiled threats will be equally successful in instilling fear, the evil the statute wasdesigned to eradicate. Second, the ECT statute deals only with the circumstances when theloan is made; a separate provision prohibits extortionate collection tactics. See notes 228-33 and accompanying text infra. Third, even phony threats will often harm the debtor byinstilling mental anxiety when he defaults. Since the creditor expects this result, he"understands" that default "could result in the use of... other criminal means," i.e., thethreats which the debtor recalls, to cause harm. See 18 U.S.C. ¤ 891(6) (1976).  228 For an explanation of the various terms used in this Article to refer to the collectionprocess, see note 237 infra.  229 See, e.g., ARiz. Rev. STAT.

A lender, for example,<pagebreak>                              CORNELL LAW REVIEW                             [Vol. 65:127tralegal methods of enforcing their unconscionable agreementswhich this statute is designed to restrain." 2 3 4        The elements of the offense are: "(1) that there was principalor interest outstanding on the loans, (2) that the defendants actu-ally collected or attempted to collect sums due, and (3) that the                                                                                           23 5defendants employed extortionate means to collect [the] same."Reading a state-of-mind requirement into the statute, courts                                                                                           2 36have insisted upon knowing participation by the defendant.The statute applies not only to participants in organized crime,                                                                                           237but to anyone using extortionate means to collect an extension               23 8of credit.       a. Conduct. The primary conduct prohibited by the statute iscollecting, attempting to collect, or punishing for nonpayment. 2 39 Fewdecisions have turned on the definitions of these terms; theirmeaning in the context of prosecutions under the collection law ismay not intend to use force in collecting a debt, or he may not intend to suggest thepossibility that force will be used. When the debtor defaults, however, the lender maybecome incensed and threaten violence if the debtor does not repay. On these facts, thesewould be no violation of the ECT law, but the lender could be convicted for using extor-tionate means to collect. See, e.g., United States v. Benedetto, 558 F.2d 171, 177 n.3, 178(3d Cir. 1977). On the other hand, an extortionate understanding may accompany the loanagreement, but outside events, such as arrest or repayment, may preclude the.use of extor-tionate collection techniques. On these facts, there would presumably be a violation of theECT law, but no collection law violation.      The federal collection law, 18 U.S.C. ¤ 894 (1976), has proven to be a valuable com-plement to the ECT law as a weapon against loansharking and organized crime. In fact, there are considerably more cases under the federal collection law than under the compan-ion ECT statute.   234 United States v. Natale, 526 F.2d 1160, 1165 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 950(1976).   235 Id. at 1166.   236 See, e.g., United States v. Benedetto, 558 F.2d 171, 178 (2d Cir. 1977).   237 The phrase "to collect an extension of credit" is imprecise; "extension of credit" re-fers to the agreement to enter into the loan or other transaction, and the agreement itself isnot collected. See note 199 and accompanying text supra. The statute itself, however, usesthis imprecise language. 18 U.S.C. ¤ 894(a). In addition, to refer to the collection of"debts" would be misleading, since the collection law also applies to transactions that arenot debts in the traditional sense of the term. See notes 199-209 and accompanying textSUpra.      Throughout this Article, therefore, the phrases "collection of debts," "collection ofcredit," and "collection of an extension of credit" are variously used to refer to the collec-tion process within the meaning of the collection laws.   231E.g., United States v. Annerino, 495 F.2d 1159, 1164-65 (7th Cir. 1974).   23.9 18 U.S.C. ¤ 894(a) (1976). 18 U.S.C. ¤ 891(5) contains this definition: "To collect anextension of credit means to induce in any way any person to make repayment thereof."<pagebreak>  19801                                LOANSHARKING usually self-evident. In United States v. Papia,2 4 ¡ for example, ample evidence suggested that the defendants conspired to burn down a restaurant, kidnap its owner, and break his wrists after he defaulted on a $5,000 loan. 24 ' The court found this evidence sufficient to support the charge of conspiracy to collect the debt                                                                     242 and to punish the failure to repay the loan.        b. Attendant Circumstances. Two attendant circumstances are prerequisites to conviction under the collection law: (1) the exis- tence of an extension of credit, and (2) the participation "in any                                                                                             243way ... in the use of any extortionate means . . . " to collect.        The extension-of-credit requirement is identical to that im- posed by the ECT law; 2 44 thus, the courts read the requirement broadly. In United States v. Briola,2 45 for example, where the evi- dence showed that during a meeting with the victim, the defen- dants beat him and kneed him in the groin, the defendants didnot contest the fact that they punished the victim.                           246                                                                                      Instead,they contended that the beating was punishment for a theft ratherthan for nonrepayment of a loan. 2 47 The victim, an employee ina bookmaking operation, had placed bets of his own in someoneelse's name, had lost, and then had claimed that the bettor wouldnot pay.24 8 The court stated that "extension of credit" was notlimited to a loan "in the sense of money passing," but was "di-rected to the use of extortionate means . . . to collect monies[owed], regardless of whether the loan arose from a traditional                       24 9type of loan."                 The loan itself need not have been extortionateat the     outset.2 50       In fact, the prosecutor need not even prove thatthe alleged debtor admitted his liability for the obligation. 2 5 '   240 560 F.2d 827 (7th Cir. 1977).   241 Id. at 832-33.   242 Id. at 834.   243 18 U.S.C. ¤ 894(a) (1976).   244 in the federal law "to extend credit" is defined by 18 U.S.C. ¤ 891(1) (1976), and thedefinition applies to both the ECT and collection provisions. See notes 195-209 and accom-panying text supra.   245 465 F.2d 1018 (10th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1108 (1973).   24r Id. at 1020-21.   247 Id. at 1021.   248 Id. at 1020.   249 Id. at 1021.   20 See, e.g., id.

Annerino, 495 F.2d 1159, 1165-66 (7th Cir.1974); note 233 and accompanying text supra.   2"1 E.g., United States v. Nace, 561 F.2d 763, 770-71 (9th Cir. 1977).<pagebreak>                             CORNELL LAW REVIEW                          [Vol. 65:127        Interpretation of the second attendant circumstance, partici- pation in the use of "extortionate means," pivots on the statutory definition of that term: "any means which involves the use, or anexpress or implicit threat of use, of violence or other criminalmeans to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of                   252any person."       The cases suggest four ways to satisfy the extortionate meansrequirement: (1) by collecting or attempting to collect an extor-tionate loan, (2) by making an implicit threat, (3) by making anexplicit threat, or (4) by using violence or other criminal means.       (i) Collection of an Extortionate Loan. According to the court inUnited States v. Nakaladski,25 3 if the collector of a loan knows thatthe loan was extortionate when made (i.e., that the requisite un-derstanding existed), then he violates the law either by attemptingto collect in any way or even by accepting payments.2 5 4 Accord-ing to this reasoning, it is not necessary to show use or threateneduse of violence; collection of a loan known to be extortionate, bydefinition, constitutes an extortionate collection. 255 The borrowerwill recall the extortionate understanding that was present whenthe loan was made, and he will suffer the type of pressure thatthe collection law was intended to eradicate. 5 6       (ii) Implicit Threats. In United States v. Curcio, 25 1 the courtstruggled with the statutory language "implicit threat," which wasunder attack as unconstitutionally vague.2 5 8 Declaring that Con-gress, in using this language, "simply incorporated well establishedfederal decisional law of extortion into the Act," 25 9 the court con-cluded:      Acts or statements constitute implicit threats only if they instill      fear in the person to whom they are directed or are reasonably      calculated to do so in light of the surrounding circumstances      and there is an intent on the part of the person             who performs                                                               260      the act or makes the statement to instill fear.  252 18 U.S.C. ¤ 891(7) (1976).  253 481 F.2d 289 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1064 (1973).  254 Id. at 298.  255 Id.  256 See note 227 supra.  257 310 F. Supp. 351 (D. Conn. 1970).  258 Id. at 356. The defendant claimed that the vagueness of this language rendered theprovision void under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.

Largent 264 held that introduc- tion of evidence under this provision is consistent with Federal Rule of Evidence 404.265 The court also stated, however, that to be admissible, the reputation evidence "must be substantially simi- lar and near in time to the offense charged, must be in issue, and must have more probative value than prejudicial impact." 2 6 6        The minimum requirement for an implicit threat is that "the actor knows that his words or act ought reasonably to be taken as a threat." 267 Proof of threats may come from testimony    261 18 U.S.C. ¤ 894(b) (1976).   262 The federal provision, 18 U.S.C. ¤ 894(c) (1976), is typical. It conditions admission of reputation evidence on a showing either that the extension of credit is unenforceable through the civil judicial process or that the annual rate of interest exceeds 45%.   263 See notes 454-55 and accompanying text supra.   264 545 F.2d 1039 (6th Cir. 1976), cert denied, 429 U.S. 1098 (1977).   265 Id. at 1043 (citations omitted). Federal Rule of Evidence 404 states:        Evidence of prior conduct is not admissible to prove the character of a person       or another crime, but rather is admissible to prove motive, opportunity, intent,        preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident.   266 Id. (citation omitted). Cf. United States v. Joines, 327 F. Supp. 253, 255-56 (D.                                                                                            Del. 1971) (court notes in dicta that Congress, in this provision, intended to broaden rules of evidence and by-pass some strict exclusionary rules); Pub. L. No. 90-321, ¤ 201, 82 Stat. 146, 159 (1968) (congressional finding that "[a]mong the factors which have rendered pastefforts at prosecution almost wholly ineffective has been the existence of exclusionary rulesof evidence stricter than necessary for the protection of constitutional rights.").   267 United States v. DeStafano, 429 F.2d 344, 347 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S.972 (1971).      The DeStafano formulation of the state-of-mind requirement differs from the court'sinterpretation in United States v. Curcio, 310 F. Supp. 351 (D. Conn. 1970):       Acts or statements constitute implicit threats only if they instill fear in the per-       son to whom they are directed or are reasonably calculated to do so in light of       the surrounding circumstances and there is an intent on the part of the person who       performs the act or makes the statement to instillfear.Id. at 357 (emphasis added).     The DeStafano formulation requires that the defendant knew that he was making athreat, while the Curcio interpretation requires that he intended to instill fear. If a lenderintends to place another in fear, however, surely he knows that his acts or statements arethreats. If the "intent" standard is used, therefore, there is no need to instruct the juryconcerning a "knowledge" requirement.<pagebreak>                               CORNELL LAW REVIEW                              [Vol. 65:127 of the defendant's reputation for using violent collection tac- tics. 268     As the court remarked in United States v. Spears,26                        9                                                                                            the "threat of violent consequences comes from the general nature of all the loan and collection transactions, and from defendant's reputation in the community." 27 0        (iii) Explicit Threats. A court can find that a lender used explicit threats as a collection tactic even if the defendant actually intended no harm. In United States v. Sears,2 7 ' for example, the defendant approached the debtor and demanded repayment, say- ing "'[i]f you don't have that money by Friday, I am coming to your house with my piece and I am going to blow you away.' "272 The defendant testified that he had intended his words to have a " 'psychological' effect on [the debtor] which would induce him to repay the loan." 273 He sought to escape conviction, however, byarguing that he never "owned a gun and ... [had] never intended to harm [the debtor]." 2 74 The court upheld the trial judge's juryinstruction that the issue was whether or not the defendant "in- tend[ed] to put [the debtor] in fear.... [or] use his language ...to force him to pay." 2 7 5 The fact that he intended no harm wasimmaterial. "Fear must be the intended result of the defendant'sact." 276        It is possible to convict for a collection offense even if thealleged victim denies that the defendant ever made the threat, aslong as there is sufficient other evidence. 277 "[T]he silencing of a            278victim"           by fear does not foreclose conviction.       (iv) Actual Use of Violence or Other Criminal Means. The collec-tion statute includes in its definition of extortionate means the   268 See, e.g., United States v. Spears, 568 F.2d 799, 801 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S.839 (1978) (testimony that defendants "'climbed on people,' frightening them about receiv-ing their money"); United States v.

Result. While it is necessary that fear be an intended con- sequence of a threat under this law, the statute, properly read,does not require that fear or even "comprehension" result. In thisrespect, the collection law differs from the ECT laws. 8 2 At leastone court has misread the statute and the decisions interpreting it to impose a fear result. 28 3             The statute, in fact, neither mentionsfear nor requires an inquiry into the victim's state of mind, exceptwhen evidence of the victim's, knowledge of the defendant's pastconduct is introduced to show that the defendant intended to threaten the victim. 2 8 4 "[I]t is the threat of harm which is prohib- ited ... , actual fear is not an element of the offense." 285        d. State of Mind. The collection statute requires that the de-fendant have "knowingly participate[d] ... in the use of any ex-                            ' 2 86tortionate means.

The knowing participa- tion requirement, however, covers not only those who intend to induce fear, but also those who assist the other participants with knowledge of their designs.2 90 C. Criminal Usury         1. Historical Development and Basic Principles        Despite the ancient heritage of usury proscriptions, criminalusury statutes lack common-law lineage.2 9 ' The earliest systema-tic legislative efforts to criminalize usurious lending in Americawere the small loan acts passed in the early twentieth century.2 9 2Recently, however, states have supplemented or strengthenedthese statutes with specific criminal usury proscriptions. These laws responded to an obvious yet intransigent problem:"the creditor's power over the necessitous to extort oppressiveterms.... 293denied, 402 U.S. 972 (1971), seems to require no more than knowledge that acts will be reasonably read as threats, Curcio specifically requires a specific intent to instill fear. See note 260 and accompanying text supra. We see no practical distinction between these stan- dards. If the provocateur knows that the listener will reasonably construe his actions as a threat, surely he intends to instill fear. We advise use of the "intent" formulation in fram- ing instructions since "knowledge" of a "reasonable tendency" is a slippery concept, likely to confuse jurors. DeStefano could be read as identifying a state-of-mind requirement in addition to the intent to instill fear, relating only to the conduct element of "threaten"-i.e., the defendant must know that he is threatening. But if a defendant intends to place another in fear, surely he knows that his acts are threats. Therefore, we see no need to instruct the jury on any separate state-of-mind requirement relating to this element of the crime. Indeed, the intent element renders the "reasonable tendency" conduct requirement virtually irrelevant as a practical matter because it is difficult to conceive of a situation in which one would intend to instill fear, undertake conduct to achieve that goal, but not engage in conduct with a tendency to instill fear. In light of this observation it seems that the "reasonable tendency" requirement serves no purpose save to complicate and lengthenjury instructions in these cases. These observations are not limited to ¤ 894; they apply as well to traditional extortion statutes.    28' See note 267 and accompanying text supra.    290 For a conspiracy prosecution, the jury need only find that "it was the intent of [the defendants] to use threats or actual violence ....

Elements of the Offense        Although usury statutes vary and have caused confusion among courts, 297 it is possible to generalize about the elements of the usury offense. The Florida Supreme Court summarized the typical elements of a usurious transaction:       (1) There must be a loan express or implied; (2) An under-       standing between the parties that the money lent shall be re-       turned; (3) That for such a loan a greater rate of interest than       is allowed by law shall be paid or agreed to be paid, as the case       may be; and (4) There must exist a corrupt intent to take more                                                                            29       than the legal rate for the use of the money loaned.        a. Conduct. Criminal usury statutes typically contain a two- fold conduct requirement: (1) making a loan and (2) charging, taking, agreeing to take, or receiving interest.2 9 9 Although at least one statute requires that a transaction meet a detailed defini- tion of "extension of credit," 3 0 0 most simply refer to a "loan or forbearance of any money or other property." 301 Regardless of   294 See, e.g., CAL.

Asone court poetically stated, "[Tihe concealment of the needle ofusury in a haystack of subterfuge will not                           avail to prevent its                                                              ' 30 3pricking       the   body     of   the   law   into  action."       By proscribing both "charging" or "agreeing to take" and"taking" or "receiving more than the legal rate of interest," 304 thetypical usury statute reaches any usurious agreement whether ornot the lender actually collects the interest or principal. As onecourt observed, "Clearly, the ordinary meaning of 'charge' [doesnot require] ... actual payment."305 Acceleration clauses, how-ever, are an exception to this rule; some states consider themusurious only if the lender actually receives the accelerated in-terest. 30 6 Although this interpretation may be just and, undermoney, or forbearance to enforce the collection of any sum of money"); ILL.

Courts usually look to the total benefits which the lender wouldreceive in determining the interest rate charged. See, e.g., Jenkins v. Dugger, 96 F.2d 727,729 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 305 U.S. 623 (1938).   306 See, e.g., Armstrong v. Alliance Trust Co., 88 F.2d 449, 451-52 (5th Cir. 1937) (apply-ing Mississippi law); Smith v. Western & S. Life Ins. Co., 87 F.2d 839, 841-42 (5th Cir. 1937) (applying Kansas law).      The Florida Supreme Court has fashioned a slightly different rule. Under its reason-ing, an unexercised acceleration clause does not render the transaction usurious. But if theclause is exercised the loan becomes usurious even if the lender does not claim the entireamount of the unearned interest. If the amount of interest which the lender could havecollected under the clause exceeds the legal rate, the mere exercise of the clause rendersthe transaction criminally usurious.

Attendant Circumstances. The critical attendant circumstance under usury statutes is the designated interest ceiling. Prohibited interest levels vary greatly, ranging from six percent in Tennes- see 309 and twelve percent in Arizona 3 10 to fifty percent in NewJersey. 3 1 ' Some statutes exempt those authorized or permitted by law to charge what otherwise would be usurious interest rates.31 2         c. Result. The typical usury statute requires no result. If the original agreement is usurious, repayment is unnecessary for con- viction of the lender.3 1 3        d. State of Mind. Because usury is "largely a matter of in-tent,",314 its proof generally requires a determination of the lend-er's state of mind. In some states, the lender must intentionally charge interest which he knows is in excess of the legal rate. 31 5 Florida courts will presume that a lender is acting in good faith,but will allow this presumption to be rebutted by evidence that thelender knew the rate of interest he charged was illegal. 31 6 The    307 See, e.g., S.D.

In State v. Tillem,31 8 the court stated:        There are areas where the evil or danger sought to be pre-        vented is so great that the Legislature may, as a matter of pub-        lic policy, declare an act unlawful without proof of a wrongful        intent. ...

Most states have enacted small loan laws making it a mis-demeanor either to engage in the small loan business without firstobtaining a license or to charge more than a certain interestrate. 335 At least one case involves the use of a small loan law in a  330 18 PA.

Extortion       1.Historical Development       At common law, the crime of extortion focused on officialmisbehavior, rather than private wrongdoing. "[A]ny officer's un-lawful taking, by color of his office, from any man, any money orthing of value that is not due to him, or more than is due, orbefore it is due" 345 constituted the common law misdemeanor of'extortion.3 41 Common law courts extended the official-oriented   31 Commonwealth v.

First, some English cases held that the offense embraceda threat to destroy the victim's home. 348 Bishop thought that thiswas rational, since "one without habitation is exposed to the in-clement elements; so that to deprive a man of his house is equiva-lent to inflicting personal injury upon him."'3 49 Second, in 1776,the court in Rex v. Jones 35 0 held that threats to accuse a man ofsodomy were sufficient to sustain a conviction for robbery. 5The fact that extortion embraced such threatened allegations con-founded Bishop, who commented that the rule was an "excres-                           3 52cence on the law."       Paralleling these developments in the common law of rob-bery, several statutes passed during the reigns of George I andGeorge II expanded the offense of extortion by punishing at-tempts to obtain money by sending letters threatening accusationof crimes. 353 A later provision 35 4 was held to apply to threats toexpose a clergyman's sexual activities to the church hierarchy andin the' newspapers. 55 These "blackmail" statutes did not, how-ever, encompass verbal threats. 5      This curious mixture of threats to injure person or property,to accuse of a crime or to expose a shameful act, forms the coreof modern extortion law.

Elements of the Offense         a. Conduct and Result. Extortion statutes fall into two major categories. A bare majority of jurisdictions require the appropria- tion of the victim's property by the defendant. 3 61 The minority proscribe the mere making of a threat with the intent to approp- riate.36 2 Some of the majority also require that the defendant instill a fear that compels or induces delivery of property by the victim. 3 63       A focus on fear can either expand or contract the scope of punishable conduct. It may expand it to embrace most conduct that in fact induces fear.36 4 Alternatively, it may contract the ambit of punishable behavior by "protecting" otherwise extor- tionate threats that fail to inspire fear in the victim. 36 5 The latter    M See, e.g., CAL.

In jurisdictions requiring fear, such transactions may, asa matter of law, constitute attempted extortion at most.3 6       In jurisdictions proscribing threats accompanied only by theintent to appropriate, the victim's state of mind is immaterial. 6 7In addition, it may be that in such jurisdictions, "[the jury will notinquire into the 'probable force and power' of the threat ... even                                                                                          3 8though the threat is not of the type which will produce terror."This reasoning should also apply where appropriation is re-quired but fear is not, ' 6 9 at least when the defendant's threats                                                3 70result in delivery of the property.       Almost every statute enumerates discrete harms that must bethreatened to give rise to the offense of extortion.3 7 ' Threats toinjure person or property, to accuse of a crime, and to expose asecret injuring another's reputation are universally proscribed. 7Most jurisdictions go beyond these common law staples and ap-proximate Model Penal Code ¤ 223.4, which also prohibits threatsto:             (d) take or withhold action as an official, or cause an offi-       cial to take or withhold action; or             (e) bring about or continue a strike, boycott or other col-       lective unofficial action, if the property is not demanded or re-       ceived for the benefit of the group in whose interest the actor       purports to act; or             (f) testify or provide information or withhold testimony or       information with respect to another's legal claim or defense; orof the offense, it may dominate the entire analysis by becoming the chief "circumstance"from which the other elements of extortion are inferred.

STAT. ¤ 28-513 (Supp. 1978).   370 This point is mainly of theoretical interest; it is difficult to hypothesize a case inwhich appropriation results from a threat that does not inspire actual fear. The govern-ment agent case, however, poses an interesting possibility. If the agent delivers propertyafter a threat is made, despite the absence of actual fear, the delivery arguably "results"from the threat, for without the threat delivery would not have occurred.   31' See, e.g., ARIz.

The defendant can raise this defense if he was honestly seeking the property either as restitution or indemnification for the harm that was the subject of his threatened accusation, exposition, or official action, or as compensation for property or lawful services.376        The threat is the core of any extortionate transaction. Proving that the defendant threatened one of the enumerated harms is frequently difficult, and determining whether the defendant'swords or acts were likely to intimidate the victim requires close scrutiny of all relevant circumstances.3 7 7 Courts have shown awillingness to search for implicit threats in apparently innocent circumstances.37 8 For example, a Michigan court grappled with the distinction between an "intelligible" and "unintelligible" threatwhile reviewing the extortion conviction of an individual who, during an assault trial involving a friend, told a female witness in the assault trial that "'[s]omebody needs to beat your butt; youain't going to stay in this courthouse forever . . . . , ,79                         The                                               3 80court affirmed the conviction.

In holding that "wrongful," as used in the federal Hobbs Act, modified the entire acquisitive scheme andnot solely the use of fear, the Supreme Court limited the statute'sreach to instances where the defendant had no lawful claim to theproperty obtained. 3 9 "[T]he use of force to achieve legitimatecollective-bargaining demands" is therefore not a federal of-fense. 39 0   38  See, e.g., United States v.

The broadest are found in laws punishing mere threats, and include the intent to compel another to act against his will. 3 9 1                           Some                                                                                           39 2jurisdictions specify that the threat must be made "maliciously." Others require that property be obtained "knowingly." 393 The state of mind requirement rarely necessitates a special inquiry since felonious intent is ordinarily inferred from the threat it- self.3 94        No extortion statute expressly prescribes a mental state for attendant circumstances. General provisions governing culpability may identify the requisite state of mind. These provisions nor- mally direct that the mental state specified in the statute be applied to all the elements of the offense unless a contrary pur- pose plainly appears.3 95        3. Other Statutory Provisions        The basic extortion provisions may not exhaust a jurisdic- tion's treatment of the illicit use of threats. In jurisdictions whereextortion entails actual appropriation, unavailing threats may con-stitute blackmail 39 6 or criminal coercion.3 97 Threatening with the intent to compel behavior, even if it is not extortion, may bepunished as coercion 3 98 or intimidation.3 9 9 Mere threatening,without any specific intent, is a crime in some jurisdictions; the(1976).

As in proving the standard ex-tortionate threat, the victim will often provide crucial testimonyfrom which the6 jury may infer the existence of the parties' "un-                     41derstanding."        Where the prosecution is unable to prove these elementsthrough direct evidence, it must search for other evidence, andresulting problems have required a rethinking of basic evi-dentiary principles.B. Equivocal Conduct and Circumstantial Evidence         In many loansharking and extortion cases, threats are veiled;the defendant uses implicit rather than explicit threats to induce    "" Under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. ¤ 1951 (1976), the victim's testimony suffices toprove actual fear.

The pros-ecution should introduce evidence showing that the defendant had the power to carry outhis threats, or that the victim reasonably believed the defendant had the power. See UnitedStates v.

The very fear which must be proved often silences keywitnesses and threatens to sabotage the prosecution.4 1 s In eithersituation, proof of criminal conduct requires heavy reliance oncircumstantial evidence.       As long ago as 1884, the New York Court of Appeals recog-nized the potential difficulty of showing intimidation. Speaking ofa letter which appeared friendly, but was alleged to carry a threat,the court said:       No precise words are needed to convey a threat. It may be       done by innuendo or suggestion. To ascertain whether a letter       conveys a threat, all its language, together with the cir-       cumstances under which it was written, and the relations be-       tween the parties may be considered, and if it can be found that       the purport and natural effect of the letter is to 419               convey a       threat, then the mere form of words is unimportant.       More recently, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusettsallowed the jury to find a threat where the language was equivocalbut where the defendant brought a "big, bald-headed man [who]                                                                            420looked like a wrestler" to a meeting with the victim.       Perhaps the most devastating and significant circumstantialevidence results from the defendant's fear-inspiring character it-self. The reputation of the loanshark or extortionist, or knowledgeof his prior criminal activities, impresses upon even the most coura-geous the potential consequences of a refusal to comply with hiswishes. Nevertheless, the introduction of character evidence, even   "I   "For example, if a known 'hit' man is used to secure money or property, expressthreats may be entirely unnecessary, the reputation of the 'hit' man (with the implicit threatcarried by his presence) being sufficient to achieve the desired effect." S. REP. No. 95-605,95th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, 629 (1977) (speaking of extortion statute).   418 The major difficulty which confronts the prosecution of offenses of this type is       the reluctance of the victims to testify. That is, if they are in genuine fear of        the consequences of nonpayment, they are apt to be equally or even more in        fear of the consequences of testifying as a complaining witness.'CONFERENCE REPORT, supra note 194, at 29.

"<pagebreak>1980]                              LOANSHARKING if relevant, entails a high risk of prejudice to the defendant. Therefore, courts have often viewed it unfavorably. 421 Gases of loansharking and extortion, however, reveal great judicial latitude in admitting character evidence. C. CharacterEvidence        The Supreme Court in Michelson v. United States 422 rejected the use of character evidence to show the defendant's propensity to commit a crime:       Courts that follow the common-law tradition almost unani-       mously have come to disallow resort by the prosecution to any       kind of evidence of a defendant's evil character to establish a       probability of his guilt. Not that the law invests the defendant       with a presumption of good character ....but it simply closes       the whole matter of character, disposition and reputation on       the prosecution's case-in-chief. The state may not show defen-       dant's prior trouble with the law, specific criminal acts, or ill       name among his neighbors, even though such facts might logi-       cally be persuasive that he is by propensity a probable perpe-       trator of the crime. The inquiry is not rejected because charac-       ter is irrelevant; on the contrary, it is said to weigh too much       with the jury and to so over-persuade them as to prejudge one       with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to       defend against a particular charge. The overriding policy of       excluding such evidence, despite its admitted probative value, is       the practical experience that its disallowance tends to prevent      confusion of issues, unfair surprise and undue prejudice. 423       Courts admit character evidence, however, if it is "substan-tially relevant for some other purpose than to show a probabilitythat [the defendant] committed the crime on trial because he is aman of criminal character."4 2 4 If character evidence passes the   421 McCoRMIcK's HANDBOOK OF THE LAW OF EVIDENCE ¤ 188, at 445 (2d ed.

Decisional Authority for the Introduction of CharacterEvidence        a. Reputation Evidence. The leading recent case on reputation evidence is United States v. Carbo,427 a Ninth Circuit decision inter-preting the Hobbs Act. 42 In Carbo, a group of defendants triedto obtain managerial control over a welterweight boxer throughextortionate demands on his manager. 42 9 Defendant Joseph Sica,convicted of extortion and conspiracy to extort, appealed, claim-ing that evidence of his reputation as an "underworld man" and"strong arm" man was improperly admitted at trial. 30        Rejecting Sica's claim, the court noted that while the usualreason for disallowing character evidence was the probability ofundue prejudice to the defendant, 43 ' here the proof       was not introduced into the case for the purpose of characteriz-       ing him as a bad man likely to resort to the conduct with which       he is charged. This was not the source of its relevance.      The courts, for example, admit character evidence "to prove the character of a person where the question of what that character is or was, is one of the ultimate issues in the case ...

If he may, then all who       are known to live by violence are free to extort by the tacit       threat of violence conveyed by their reputations; for the       reasonableness of the resulting fear, as determined by its cause,                                                      43 4       may not be presented to the jury.        Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the Carbo decision wasits approval of the use of reputation evidence on the issue of the defendant's intent. 43 5            While there appears to be ample eviden-   432 Id. at 740-41.   433 Id. at 741.

EvID. 404(b).    137 General evidence law draws a closer connection between a person's prior acts and his intent than between his reputation and his intent.         Where the issue addressed is the defendant's intent to commit the offense        charged, the relevancy of the extrinsic offense derives from the defendant's        indulging himself in the same state of mind in the perpetration of both the        extrinsic and charged offenses. The reasoning is that because the defendant        had unlawful intent in the extrinsic offense, it is less likely that he had lawful        intent in the present offense. United States v. Beechum, 582 F.2d 898, 911 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc). This prop- osition makes sense. A single isolated incident may be the product of chance or bad for- tune. If, however, a pattern is shown, it is unlikely that one of its many parts results from chance, accident, or coercion. We do not infer from the prior acts that a person is bad and therefore a likely candidate for commission of the crime in issue. Rather we infer that if the defendant committed the act in question, he did so intentionally.       In many instances, the law clearly recognizes the relevance of prior acts to intent. See United States v. Czarnecki, 552 F.2d 698, 701 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 939 (1977); United States v. Abraham, 541 F.2d 1234, 1240 (7th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1102 (1977); United States v. Quinn, 514 F.2d 1250, 1254 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 955 (1976); United States v.

The law's emphasis on prior bad acts evidence, however, may not apply in the loansharking and extortion context, where special considerations suggest a close linkage between reputation and intent. See note 438 and accompanying textinfra. Of course, this observation does not imply that prior acts evidence is any less admis- sible in these cases; it merely indicates that courts should be more willing to admit reputa- tion evidence to prove intent.    438 See also United States v. Martorano, 557 F.2d 1, 8 n.3 (1st Cir. 1977): "[T]he victim's understanding is one of the factors from which the jury may infer the lender's intent ... This conclusion is hardly self-evident and warrants closer scrutiny.<pagebreak>  1980]                               LOANSHARKING                                        201 unaware of his own reputation for violence; reputation, by defini- tion, reflects general knowledge in the community, and, if anyone is a member of the relevant community, it is the defendant him- self.          Reputation evidence is often used to help establish the victim's state of mind-as proof of his fear and the reasonableness thereof.4 39 The state may establish the existence of reasonable fear by showing the victim's knowledge of the defendant's reputa- tion for a violent character or underworld association at the time the crime was committed; 4 40 it need not show, however, a specific                                                                                            441 reputation for violence in connection with extortionate schemes.         b. Prior-Acts Evidence. The Second Circuit in United States v.Palmiotti44 2 also faced the peculiar evidentiary problems posed by the extortion case. In Palmiotti, the business agent of the Granite Cutters Union had demanded a payoff from a construction firm in return for overlooking union regulations requiring more work- ers on the job.'" 3 The court first addressed the broader eviden- tiary issue:         [W]e hear so often in extortion cases [that] unless the threat         which induces fear in the victim is spelled out in words of one         syllable and in plain terms of a threat, there is no case for the        jury. But common sense must be used iA this class of cases as         well as others. If the jury believed [the victim's] testimony of    439 E.g., United States v. Billingsley, 474 F.2d 63, 65 (6th Cir.) (defendant's bad reputa- tion relevant to victim's fear and its reasonableness), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 819 (1973); United States v. De Masi, 445 F.2d 251, 257 (2d Cir.) (defendant's reputation for violence   relevant to victim's fear), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 882 (1971); United States v. Tropiano, 418   F.2d 1069, 1081 (2d Cir. 1969) (defendants' bad reputations relevant to victim's fear), cert.   denied, 397 U.S. 1021 (1970).   440 An analogy can also be drawn to homicide cases in which the defendant pleads self-defense. Courts commonly admit evidence of the deceased's reputation for violence ordangerousness to show that the defendant reasonably believed that deadly force was neces-sary for his own protection. See State v. Miranda, 24 CRINI. L. REP. (BNA) 2008 (Conn.Sept. 12, 1978); 2 WmoIGaOR, supra note 433, ¤ 246, at 44; Annot., 1 A.L.R.3d 571 (1965).In a loansharking case, the government may similarly attempt to prove the reasonabletendency of all the circumstances to instill fear. In situations where conduct is equivocal,character emerges as a key factor. The analogy is useful, however, only inasmuch as itdemonstrates relevancy. Prejudice to the defendant need not be considered in thehomicide cases because it is not evidence of the defendant's reputation, but of the de-ceased's, that is introduced.   441 United States v. De Masi, 445 F.2d 251, 257 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 882(1971); United States v. Carbo, 314 F.2d 718, 740 (9th Cir; 1963).   442 254 F.2d 491 (2d Cir. 1958).    443 Id. at 493-94.<pagebreak>  202                          CORNELL LAW REVIEW                              [Vol. 65:127       what appellant said to him, it was certainly within their pro-                 444       vince to infer that appellant intended [to commit extortion].        The court then ruled on the admissibility of the victim's tes- timony that he knew the defendant was involved in a similarscheme two years earlier. It held this evidence "clearly admissibleboth to show the state of mind of [the defendant] and the state of mind of his victim,"' 4 45 pointing out that the trial judge had in-structed the jury that it "must not be considered by you as anyproof of the acts charged in this indictment.

In Callanan v. United States, 44 9 the Eighth Circuitallowed the victim to testify that he knew the defendant was re-sponsible for an assault on one of his employees; 450 the courtruled that this testimony was relevant to the victim's fear not onlyof a similar assault, but of economic loss and injury to his equip-ment. 45    1                  As similarity diminishes, however, so does relevancy,   444 Id. at 495.   445 Id. at 497. The trial court did not go this far, admitting the evidence "only for thepurpose of showing the [victim's] state of mind as to why the payments were made ...[not] for any other purpose." The use of this evidence to show the defendant's intent,however, has support. See, e.g., United States v. Blount, 229 F.2d 669, 671 (2d Cir. 1956)(evidence of subsequent similar acts properly admitted to show defendant's state of mind).See also note 437 supra.   4" 254 F.2d at 497.   447 See, e.g., United States v. Tolub, 309 F.2d 286, 289 (2d Cir. 1962).   448 See, e.g., Callanan v. United States, 223 F.2d 171, 177-78 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 350U.S. 862 (1955).      In Palmiotti, the prior bad act involved a shakedown nearly identical to the crimecharged in the indictment. The same defendant threatened the same witness. Obviously,both parties knew of the prior act. More complex fact patterns may arise, however. If, forexample, the prosecution witness knew of a prior act of intimidation directed by the de-fendant at a third party, that fact should be relevant to prove the witness' fear and itsreasonableness. Whether the court should admit evidence of this knowledge to show thedefendant's intent to instill fear is a more difficult question. When the defendant knowsthat the alleged victim is aware of his prior extortive acts, intent is readily read intoequivocal conduct in the same manner as in cases in which the defendant capitalizes on hisvicious reputation. But if the prosecution cannot show that the defendant believed that thevictim knew of his previous bad acts, the conclusion that the defendant would have takenprecautions to avoid instilling fear if that were not his intent is less easily inferred.   449 Id.   4-0 Id. at 178.   451 Id. Courts are, however, more likely to admit prior acts evidence when of the sametype as the acts feared and not too remote in time. See, e.g., United States v. Quinn, 514<pagebreak>1980]                               LOANSHARKING                                           203 and courts therefore examine the degree of similarity in initiallyassessing relevancy and in striking the balance between probativevalue and prejudice.4 52        2. Statutoy Authority for the Introduction of Character Evidence        Legislatures as well as courts have recognized the reasonable-ness and importance of using character evidence to prove extor-tionate activity. 45 3 The ECT laws, 45 4 for instance, contain de-tailed provisions for the admissibility of reputation and prior-acts               455evidence.       The critical element of the ECT offense is the "understand-                                                                                            45 6ing" that violence "could result" if repayment is not timely.The law provides two methods of showing this "understanding."First, as part of a prima facie case, the state must show thedebtor's reasonable belief that the creditor had used or had areputation for using "extortionate means" 457 to collect or punishnonpayment. 458 Second, if direct evidence of this sort is unavail-F.2d 1250, 1254 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 955 (1976); United States v.

Courts, however, are less likely to admit evidencewhich may be especially influential in persuading the jury that the defendant is a bad man,such as a prior conviction for sodomy.

While this section of the statute does not specifically au-thorize the introduction of prior acts evidence to show "understanding," it is unlikely thatthe statute excludes such evidence, when admissible under general evidence law. The lack ofhearings or floor debate over these specific provisions, combined with the general congres-sional intent to ease the evidentiary burden on the government, argues against the negativeimplication that Congress wanted to be more restrictive than the common law with regardto prior-acts evidence.      See 2 J. WEINSTEIN & M. BERGER, WEINSTEIN'S EVIDENCE, 405[04] (1977) [hereinaftercited as WEINSTEIN]:        [Tihe statute, read literally, would seem to limit the prosecutor's power to use        reputation and could be read by implication to exclude other threatening acts        of the defendant. Since Congress obviously had the intention of making proof        easier rather than more difficult, such a restrictive reading seems unsound.        Thus the statute seems to be without substantial effect in changing the rules of        evidence.   46, The ECT law language could be read as restricting the use of character evidence tocertain limited situations where direct evidence of the actual belief of the debtor as to thecreditor's collection practices is not available. See 18 U.S.C. ¤ 892(c) (1976). Nonetheless,courts have shown little regard for the intricacies of the statute in admitting characterevidence. See, e.g., United States v.

Bowdach,46 2 where the defendant "contend[ed] that theintroduction of reputation evidence [was] so prejudicial that it de-prive[d] him of Due Process of law as guaranteed by the FifthAmendment." 4 63 The court's response was unequivocal:        Fear is the central element in crimes of extortion, and often the        victim may reasonably be in fear without possessing knowledge        of specific acts of the victimizer. This fear may extend beyond        the act or transaction involved, and may even follow the victim        to the witness stand .... The legislative history of the Act shows        that Congress felt it was necessary to permit the use of reputa-        tion evidence under certain circumstances, due to the reluc-        tance of loansharking victims to testify; otherwise, it might be        virtually impossible to demonstrate the victim's state of mind        toward the transaction.                  [W]here such evidence is admitted [only to464show the        victim's state of mind], the Constitution is satisfied.         In a similar constitutional challenge to the evidentiary provi-sions of an ECT companion provision,46 5 another federal courtspoke even more broadly:        When such evidence is relevant to and probative of the state of        the victim's mind and the use of implicit threats, it is admissible for        that purpose under the aforementioned established principles       of the law of evidence [citing Carbo].

The Duty to Report        The crime of misprision, historically a criminal neglect "either to prevent a felony from being committed, or to bring to justicethe offender after its commission," 467 has long embodied the callto "accuse every offender, and to proclaim every offense." 4 68 Atcommon law, if an individual knew a felony had been committedin his absence, yet neither disclosed it to the authorities noi didanything to bring the offender to punishment, he was "guilty of abreach of the duty due to the community and the govern-ment."' 4 69 Although modern jurisdictions criminally punish onlythe failure to report treason, 470 courts still recognize the moralobligation of citizens to advise authorities of criminal wrongdo-ing. 47 1 The legal duty of every citizen to testify when called uponto do so complements this moral duty. The Supreme Court hasendorsed Lord Chancellor Hardwicke's "pithy phrase" that "[t]hepublic has a right to every man's evidence." 47 2 Buttressed byimmunity statutes and the court's contempt power, the duty totestify is not relieved even by fear of physical reprisal against the                              4 73witness or his family.       Notwithstanding these lofty ideals, violence, threats of vio-lence, and fear take a relentless toll on the successful investigationand prosecution of organized crime.

The victim of extortion, already forced by fear to pay, will not then risk        his life.              Insiders are kept quiet by an ideology of silence, underwritten by a com-        pletely realistic fear that death comes to those who talk-often not mere death,        but death by torture.              Photographs of some of those grisly crimes have been shown to loan shark        victims to secure repayment of their debts. Can people such as these victims        really be expected to step forward to testify?              Unimplicated witnesses have been, and are now, regularly bribed,        threatened, or murdered. Scores of cases have been lost because key witnesses        turned up in rivers in concrete boots.

The Duty to Protect       A humane society can neither capitulate to its criminal ele- ment nor exact martyrdom as the price for performing basic civic duties. Courts have therefore responded to the problem of wit- ness and informant fear with a tort doctrine aimed at neutralizing criminal intimidation. Recognizing a reciprocal obligation born of citizen cooperation and the general goal of encouraging aid to law enforcement authorities, tort law imposes a duty to reasonably protect endangered informants and witnesses.      At times, this duty corresponds directly with law enforcementinterests. For example, the prosecution's desire to ensure the ap-pearance of key witnesses at trial may result in pre-trial protectiveefforts. More often, however, the government has little immediateinterest in providing protection. Informants who have "blowntheir covers" and witnesses who have already testified can gener-ally provide little, if any, additional assistance to prosecutors andpolice. Notwithstanding these practical considerations, the lawmay mandate government protection and condemn failure toprovide it as tortious.      1. Fact Patterns      In Schuster v. City of New York, 4 82 the initial and leading caseon the duty to protect, the plaintiff's intestate recognized the notor-ious bank robber, Willie Sutton, from an FBI flyer posted in hisfather's store. Schuster supplied information leading to Sutton'sapprehension, and his role in the arrest was highly publicized.After receiving threats on his life, he notified the police. Law en-forcement officials initially provided partial protection, but soonwithdrew it, assuring Schuster that the threats were not serious.Nineteen days after identifying Willie Sutton, Schuster wasshot and killed while approaching his home.      The duty to protect government witnesses and informers                                                                     483arose for the second time in Gardnerv. Village of Chicago Ridge.Police officers asked the plaintiff to identify four meu who hadassaulted him earlier in the evening. In the course of the identifi-cation, the officers left the assailants near the plaintiff, and thefour men again attacked him, inflicting serious injuries.  482 5 N.Y.2d 75, 154 N.E.2d 534, 180 N.Y.S.2d 265 (1958).   4" 71 Ill.

United States, 484 the plaintiff, a regular, paid in-formant for the Alcohol Tax Unit of the Internal Revenue Ser-vice, was scheduled to testify before a grand jury investigating anillicit whiskey operation. When Swanner learned of a threat on hislife, he promptly notified federal officials, who assured him therewas no danger and afforded him no protection. Three days be-fore he was to testify, a bomb exploded under the plaintiff'shouse injuring him and members of his family.        In each of these cases, the court upheld the plaintiff's damageaction against the government for failing to discharge its duty toprotect. Many other reported decisions recognize the existence of                                                                                   485such a duty to protect witnesses and informants in dicta.        2.

Ifcourts and juries choose to emphasize this factor, authorities mayinvite potentially staggering liability by dismissing a witness's fears,even where there is no clear indication of danger. Confirmingfears out of cautiousness, however, without providing protection,may well terminate continued witness cooperation or subjectauthorities to claims of estoppel if they assert the absence of rea-sonable danger in a subsequent damage action. To avoid theseconsequences, authorities may find themselves forced to provideprotection even in cases involving remote possibilities of harm.       3. Scope of the Duty to Protect       Once a duty to protect arises, the government must exercise"reasonable" care to protect the person or persons endangered, 495 apparently the extent of his relationship with law enforcement officials.

Practical Considerations        The decision in Schuster immediately engendered predictions of dire financial consequences; skeptics predicted frequent and substantial court awards 498 and burdensome outlays in providing protection. 499 For various reasons, these consequences have not materialized. First, the law does not mandate protection until it reasonably appears that the informant or witness is in danger. This requirement normally obviates the duty to protect absent a credible showing of threats. Second, the protection need only be reasonable. Personal bodyguards are seldom required, and protec- tion may be limited to a reasonable period of time.        The effectiveness of witness relocation programs constitutes afinal, and perhaps the most significant, reason for the generallymoderate cost of protection. 50 0 If an individual requires constantprotection for an extended time, the government may give him anew identity and relocate him in another part of the country. Re-location efforts have met with substantial success. The federalgovernment's $11,000,000-a-year program relocates approxi-mately five hundred persons annually. 50 1 In 1976 the program'sdirector asserted that to his knowledge, no one in the programhad ever been killed because of his or her cooperation with gov-                              50 2ernment authorities.   496 Swanner v.

Implicationsfor Law Enforcement Officers        Faced with the prospect of costly tort actions, government of- ficials must take precautionary steps to avoid liability. In consider- ing the source and scope of the protection duty, the finder of fact will be viewing the government's actions with 20-20 hindsight. InSwanner, for example, the federal officers' conclusion that the plaintiff was not in danger may have been wholly reasonable. Swanner lived in Montgomery, Alabama, and the officers believed that the leader of the whiskey ring was in Tennessee, at the site of the still. Authorities had no apparent reason to believe that any ring members were in the Montgomery area. Moreover, Swanner learned of the threat solely through hearsay.        The distorting effects of hindsight also appeared in a recent New York case 50 3 in which a former boyfriend threatened and subsequently killed his lover and her husband. The appellate divi-sion reversed the trial court's dismissal of the wrongful deathcomplaint, even though the police warned the victims of thethreat, advised them to take precautions, and maintained a patrolin the vicinity of the victims' home. C. Nondisclosure of Witness Identities        Modern commentators have advocated a system of liberal criminal discovery, including disclosure of prosecution witnesses, as a wise alternative to a sporting theory of justice.50 4 Timely identification of witnesses facilitates defense planning and pretrialinvestigation. Most importantly, it increases the defendant's ability    503 Zibbon v. Town of Cheektowaga, 51 A.D.2d 448, 382 N.Y.S.2d 152 (4th Dep't 1976). While Zibbon did not involve a witness or informant, it bears directly on the scope of theprotection duty. The duty to protect may arise out of circumstances other than cooperationwith government authorities. Although such cases are of limited importance in determiningwhen the duty to protect witnesses or informants arises, they may cast substantial light onhow much protection is reasonable. In Zibbon the duty to protect matured out of an "as- sumption of duty," which requires nonnegligent performance of tasks voluntarily under- taken. Even if a jurisdiction were not to follow Schuster and its progeny, this doctrine mightimpose on governmental units the duty to protect witnesses and informants. See Schuster v. City of New York, 5 N.Y.2d 75, 87, 154 N.E.2d 534, 541, 180 N.Y.S.2d 265, 275 (1958) (concurring opinion, McNally, J.).    504 American Bar Associations standards recommend broad disclosure in criminal cases"to provide adequate information for informed pleas, expedite trials, minimize surprise, afford opportunity for effective cross-examination, and meet the requirements of due proc- ess."

WRIGHT, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE: CRIMINAL ¤ 252, at 493(1969) ("There is vast literature on the subject, and it is almost entirely favorable to broad criminal discovery.").<pagebreak>214                            CORNELL LAW REVIEW                                 [Vol. 65:127to prepare for cross-examination.

When the prosecution can demonstrate a genuine possibilityof these consequences, nondisclosure of witness identities is likelyto advance, rather than frustrate, the search for the truth.        1. Constitutional Dimensions of the Duty to Disclose       Invoking the due process guarantee of a "fair trial," defenseattorneys have attempted to constitutionalize a duty to disclosewitness identities. In Brady v. Maryland,50 6 the Court held that"suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an ac-cused upon request violates due process where the evidence ismaterial either to guilt or to punishment." 50 7 Although Bradydoes not address the issue of witness anonymity, proponents of aconstitutional right to obtain pretrial                     disclosure of witness iden-                                                     50 8tities have relied on its rationale.       The Brady-based argument for witness disclosure rests on thepractical effects of nondisclosure: absent knowledge of his accus-   505 See United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975); United States v.Holmes, 343 A.2d 272 (D.D.C. 1975). Others have argued that strict limits on discoveryadvance the truth-finding goal of trial by minimizing intimidation of witnesses and de-ployment of artifices designed to obscure the actual facts. See Flannery, Prosecutor'sPosition:Arguments and IllustrationsAgainst Liberalization of Defense Discovery Rules; Need for Prosecutor'sDiscovery of Specific Defenses (Alibi, Insanity, Etc.), 33 F.R.D. 74, 78-80 (1963) (liberal discov-ery in criminal cases would encourage perjury, bribery, and intimidation of governmentwitnesses); Speeches Delivered at the Conference of the NationalDistrict Attorneys Association, Panelon Pre-Trial Discovery in Criminal Cases, 31 BROOKLYN L. REv. 320, 326 (1965) (liberal dis-covery in criminal cases would encourage "fabrication of spurious defenses by the defen-dant") (statement of Paul B. Johnson, Fla. State Attorney).   506 373 U.S. 83 (1963).   507 Id. at 87. In Brady, petitioner and a companion were found guilty of first degreemurder and sentenced to death. At his trial, Brady admitted participation in the crime butclaimed that his companion did the actual killing. In an extrajudicial statement, the com-panion admitted to the killing, but the prosecution withheld this statement until afterBrady's conviction.   508 See note 514 and accompanying text infra.<pagebreak> 19801                            LOANSHARKING                                       215 ers' identities, the defendant will be unable to gather rebuttal evi- dence and prepare for cross-examination by investigating the background and pending testimony of key prosecution witnes- ses.5 0 9 Moreover, absent pretrial disclosure, prosecution witnesses will frequently surprise defense counsel, making it more difficult to challenge the prosecution's case.5 10 Similarly, without disclo- sure, the defense will lack the opportunity prior to trial to refresh the witness's memory, raise questions regarding the accuracy of his account, and thereby influence his direct testimony. Finally, nondisclosure precludes meeting with the witness while the events are freshest in his mind; a faltering memory might be averted by prompt prodding. Citing these factors, defense counsel have ar- gued that nondisclosure violates the "fair trial" right recognized inBrady.       Despite this argument, the Supreme Court distinguishedBrady from the typical witness-disclosure case in Weatherford v.Bursey.51 1 Prosecution witnesses, by definition, provide evidenceunfavorable to the defendant; thus the defendant's legitimate in-terest in obtainingfavorable information and the prosecution's ob-ligation of fair play-at least as defined in Brady-are absent inthis context.5 1 2       Weatherford involved a prosecution for vandalizing SelectiveService offices in Columbia, South Carolina. After Weatherford, agovernment informer, testified for the prosecution at trial, Bur-sey, the defendant, was convicted. After serving his sentence, Bur-sey sued for violation of his civil rights, asserting that the prosecu-tion's refusal to identify Weatherford as a witness before trial de-prived him of due process.5 13 Citing Brady, the court of appealsheld that the state was constitutionally forbidden to "conceal theidentity of an informant from a defendant during his trial prep-   509 Cf A.

The practice ofwithholding all information until trial has been supplanted by discovery standards thatencourage the parties to exchange all relevant information bearing on the case.

Judicial Discretion to Compel Disclosure        a. Sources of Discretion. Notwithstanding Supreme Court re-jection of a constitutional mandate, courts recognize a general dis- cretion to compel disclosure of witness identities even in the ab-    514 528 F.2d 483, 487 (4th Cir. 1975).      5 429 U.S. at 559-60. Related to the due process claim is an argument based on the sixth amendment, which guarantees the criminal defendant the right to confront witnesses against him. Although the defendant always will receive the opportunity to face and cross- examine the witness at trial, he may nonetheless argue that pretrial nondisclosure so seri- ously hinders effective cross-examination that it renders the confrontation clause a hollow guarantee. See note 509 supra.       Apparently no reported decision addresses the sixth amendment claim; but such an argument is not likely to succeed. Policies underlying the sixth amendment claim closely parallel those underlying the due process argument. Thus, rejection of the due process claim portends repudiation of the confrontation claim. In State v. Booton, 114 N.H. 750, 329 A.2d 376 (1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 919 (1975), for example, the defendant ap- pealed from the trial court's denial of her motion for disclosure of a list of witnesses prior to trial. Although the court noted that "providing defendant with a list of witnesses prior to trial promotes fairness, adequate preparation, and courtroom efficiency" (id. at 754, 329 A.2d at 380), it rejected the defendant's due process claim, concluding that there was no error in the denial of the motion. The court's refusal of disclosure in the face of considera- tions of fairness and adequate preparation strongly suggests that a right of confrontation claim would meet a similarly negative response, since those considerations necessarily un- derlie the "empty right" argument based on the sixth amendment.       This conclusion finds further support in the Supreme Court's broad language in Weatherford: "There is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and Brady did not create one .... " 429 U.S at 559.

Some courts have cited the "inherent power" ofcourts. 5 17 Others have analogized to Federal Rule of CriminalProcedure 16, which specifically allows criminal discovery in othersituations.5 1 8 The most sensible source of judicial authority, how-ever, rests on a common-sense proposition: due to his active in-volvement in the administration of criminal justice, the trial judgeis in the best position to administer the law and protect the rights          51 9of all.   "' See, e.g., United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 299 (2d Cir. 1975). See also UnitedStates v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975).  517 See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 508 F.2d 1001, 1007 (7th Cir. 1975) (upholding,on basis of trial court's "inherent power," dismissal of indictment on grounds of govern-ment's refusal to comply with pretrial order to identify witnesses).  518 See generally note 520 infra.     The Ninth Circuit, in United States v. Richter, 488 F.2d 170 (9th Cir. 1973), looked toFED. R. CRIM. P. 16 in establishing a procedure to balance the conflicting interests involvedin the witness disclosure issue. Recognizing that the rule applies only to documents andphysical objects, the court concluded that it could nonetheless help solve witness disclosureproblems. 488 F.2d at 174. The court asserted that if a defendant desires discretionarydisclosure of the government's witnesses, he should make a showing similar to that re-quired by rule 16(a)(l)(C):       Upon request of the defendant the government shall permit the defendant to       inspect and copy or photograph books, papers, documents ... which are within       the possession, custody or control of the government, and which are material to       the preparation of his defense or are intended for use by the government as evi-       dence in chief at the trial ....(Emphasis added). After noting the mandatory character of the provision, the courtpointed to rule 16(d)(1), a companion section which allows courts to issue protective orders.The court concluded that, "[f]ollowing these procedures will insure that there is anadequate basis for requesting such discovery and will afford the government a knownmethod for resisting the request." 488 F.2d at 175. But cf. United States v. Larson, 555F.2d 673, 676 (8th Cir. 1977) (under rule 16, "[i]t is clear that defendant is not entitled tothe names of government witnesses"); United States v. Jackson, 508 F.2d 1001, 1007 (7thCir. 1975) ("the discretion employed by the district court ... need [not] be limited to a de-fense showing of materiality and reasonableness"); United States v. Hearst, 412 F. Supp.863, 867 (N.D. Cal. 1975) ("[Richter's] continued validity is suspect.").     Although rule 16 provides a procedural scheme for dealing with disclosure requests, itfails to articulate useful factors to be considered in reaching a decision. The rule gives noguidance in determining what is "material to the preparation of [defendant's] defense."Nor does the rule specify when protective orders should issue, although it is obvious thatone would be appropriate where there is reason to believe that a witness would be subjectto physical or economic harm if his identity is revealed.      Given the rule's lack of guidance, the analogy drawn to rule 16 does little more thanestablish a procedural framework for the presentation of motions to disclose. While appli-cation of rule 16 tends to tip the scales against the prosecutor by requiring a "sufficientshowing," the court must still balance interests without guidance as to which "interests" arerelevant or crucial.   "' See McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 309 (1967) (dictum) (Roviaro balancing test re-garding disclosure of informant identities rests on courts' supervisory powers); United<pagebreak> 218                           CORNELL LAW REVIEW                               [Vol. 65:127        b.

Richter, 488 F.2d 170, 173-74 (9th Cir. 1973) (district court empowered to effec-tuate "speedy and orderly administration of justice").   520 An issue closely related to witness disclosure concerns whether an indictment allegingextortion or other loanshark-related crimes must identify the alleged victim. As a generalrule, the indictment must state the elements of the offense ,charged and describe the actsalleged in sufficient detail to allow preparation of the defense and protect the defendant'sdouble jeopardy claim in the event of a second prosecution. Russell v. United States, 369U.S. 749, 763-64 (1962). Problems arise in at least two situations.      First, in some cases the grand jury will not know who the victim is, but will be able tostate the time, place, and method of the crime. In such cases failure to name the victimshould not prove fatal to the indictment. Because the prosecution's proof will not focus onthe victim or include hi testimony, specific identification of the alleged criminal act bytime, place, and language used provides the defendant with sufficient information to pre-pare his defense and preserve his double jeopardy claim. Cf United States v. Rizzo, 373 F.Supp. 204, 205-06 (S.D.N.Y. 1973) (court upheld indictment that "spell[ed] out allegedextortion scheme in considerable detail, [but did] not state name of [victim]," but suggestedthat the fact that conspiracy was charged and not substantive crime of extortion was cru-cial), aff'd, 492 F.2d 443 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 944 (1974).      Second, cases arise in which the grand jury knows the victim's identity, but-in orderto protect the victim-hands down an indictment which, while alleging specific facts, issufficiently ambiguous to render the victim's identity uncertain. Such a situation mightoccur, for example, when a loanshark has made a number of usurious loans of similar sizeduring a limited time period.      Eight reasons favor judicial liberality in upholding indictments in such cases. First, allthe considerations favoring witness nondisclosure (see notes 525-26 and accompanying textinfra) are especially applicable in this context; since the victim is likely to be the key pros-ecution witness, he is particularly vulnerable to attempts to eliminate or alter his testimonyat trial. Second, nondisclosure in the indictment may protect the victim from any chance ofreprisals, since if the defendant pleads guilty to the offense alleged or a lesser relatedoffense, disclosure need never occur. Third, nondisclosure benefits the defendant, since itprovides him with an enhanced plea negotiation position. Because of the prosecution'sinterest in protecting the would-be witness, the defendant may obtain a more favorabledisposition by foregoing any potential right to discover the victim's name.      Fourth, nondisclosure in the indictment alleviates the need for the police to provideprotection throughout the entire pre-trial period; this not only saves taxpayer dollars, butavoids the unacceptable result of requiring the state to forego prosecution in cases wherethe defendant is likely to be able to "reach" the victim prior to trial. Mandatory witnessdisclosure statutes implicitly recognize this problem by requiring disclosure only a shorttime before trial. See notes 544-46 and accompanying text infra.      Fifth, double jeopardy concerns may be minimized by careful delineation of facts inthe indictment and liberal construction of the initial indictment in the event of a secondprosecution.      Sixth, nondisclosure in the indictment will not adversely affect the defendant in prepar-ing his defense. He can always request disclosure via a bill of particulars, and, at the veryleast, will-learn the victim's identity at trial. As in the typical witness nondisclosure case, amid-trial continuance can protect-and indeed improve-the defendant's ability to presenthis defense. See notes 541-43 and accompanying text infra.<pagebreak>19801                                LOANSHARKING                                         219        On one side of the balance lies the defendant's interest inpreparing his defense, 521 an interest that arguably increases withthe severity of possible punishment 522 and the complexity of theunderlying factual situation. 5 23 Considerations of judicial con-venience and expediency, as well as problems in effectiiely con-ducting voir dire, also support disclosure.5 2 4        Against these benefits, however, courts must weigh the possi-                                                                       525 or injury 526 ofble harms of pretrial identification. Intimidation      Seventh, it is theoretically inconsistent to permit nondisclosure if the grand jury isunaware of the victim's identity, but to require it in this context. The sufficiency of anindictment's allegations does not depend on the grand jury's subjective state but on theobjective notice provided. In either context the most sensible result is to uphold the in-dictment and deal with the disclosure issue if identification is requested in a bill of particu-lars.      Eighth, existing authority supports this result. In Sanchez v. United States, 341 F.2d379, 380 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 940 (1965), the First Circuit upheld nondisclosureof the purchaser's identity in a narcotics prosecution, reasoning that a specific descriptionof the alleged transaction, notwithstanding nondisclosure, prevented the prosecution from"roaming at large." Accord, Llamas v. United States, 226 F. Supp. 351 (E.D.N.Y. 1963),affd, 327 F.2d 657 (2d Cir. 1964). See also United States v. Tomasetta, 429 F.2d 978 (1stCir. 1970) (mere failure to name victim "might not have" warranted dismissal of indict-ment). An arguably contrary case, United States v. Agone, 302 F. Supp. 1258, 1260(S.D.N.Y. 1969), is distinguishable. In Agone, the status of the victim was an element of theoffense; since the applicable statute prohibited only threats to union members, the courtfocused on the particularity of the statute and the large number of potential victims inmandating disclosure. See also United States v. Simmons, 96 U.S. 360 (1878); Lauer v.United States, 320 F.2d 187 (7th Cir. 1963).   521 See United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975); Carnivale v. State, 271, So. 2d 793, 795, (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1973) (per curiam).   522 18 U.S.C. ¤ 3432 (1976), for example, provides for mandatory disclosure of witnessesin capital cases. See note 544 supra. Courts might analogize to the statute in reasoning thatthe greater the severity of the possible sentence, the greater the need for disclosure.   52 See United States v. Murphy, 480 F.2d 256, 259 (1st Cir.) (court upheld denial ofdefendant's motion for discovery of witnesses' names, in part because of "simple nature ofthe underlying factual situation"), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 912 (1973).   524 See United States v. Jackson, 508 F.2d 1001, 1007 (7th Cir. 1975) (suggesting prob-lem of juror who discovers relationship with witness after trial begins).   521 United States v. Bolden, 514 F.2d 1301, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (evidence of threatsagainst witnesses). Cf People v. Andre W., 44 N.Y.2d 179, 186, 375 N.E.2d 758, 762, 404 N.Y.S.2d 578, 582 (1978) (danger of intimidation of witness whom prosecution did not intend to call).   52 United States v. Clardy, 540 F.2d 439, 442 (9th Cir.) (disclosure of names and exact whereabouts of inmates who planned to testify might endanger witnesses), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 963 (1976). Cf. United States v. Baum, 482 F.2d 1325, 1331 (2d Cir. 1973) (witness in federal custody secure from danger).       Concern for the safety of the witness is especially strong where the witness is also an informer. In United States v. Pennick, 500 F.2d 184, 186 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1051 (1974), the Tenth Circuit observed that "informers whose identity is revealed prior to trial are often among the missing when the trial date rolls around."<pagebreak> 220                          CORNELL LAW REVIEW                             [Vol. 65:127 witnesses and subornation of perjury are recurrent dangers,5 27 especially in organized crime prosecutions.5 2 8 The courts have isolated a number of factors supporting nondisclosure due to the possibility of these abuses. Where the defendant's position might                                                                                            52 9 facilitate reprisals, for example, disclosure appears undesirable.         In People v. Lopez,53 ¡ the court delayed disclosure, citing the witnesses' actual fear inspired by knowledge of the defendant's past conduct; 531 in addition, a probation officer had characterized the defendant as a "desperate inmate and leader of disorder and                                                                                    5 32 likely to be a continuous menace and source of trouble."         Harassment of others associated with the case also militatesagainst disclosure.5 3 3 In United States v. Cannone,5 3 4 the SecondCircuit held that the district court erred in sustaining withoutmeaningful explanation the defense's motion for pretrial discov-ery of witness names. The appellate court noted the indictment ofseveral of the defendants for beating a grand jury witness as well                                                                                           5 35as "the absence of specific evidence of the need for disclosure."        Since Cannone involved alleged attacks on actual participantsin the judicial process, it is arguably distinguishable from typicalloanshark and extortion prosecutions which involve allegations ofviolence outside the judicial setting. Cannone's logic, however,applies to all cases involving indictments for violent crimes. Agrand jury indictment-a source independent of the prosecutor-indicates probable cause to believe the defendant has engaged inviolence. 53 6 This independent source bolsters the prosecutor's as-sessment of the potential danger of reprisal for witness coopera-        5 37tion.    527 United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975); United States v. Per-  cevault, 490 F.2d 126, 131 (2d Cir. 1974).     528 See Harrington v. State, 110 So. 2d 495, 497 (Fla. Dist. Ct.

Impact of the Tort-Based Duty to Protect. Tort law imposes an affirmative duty on government officials to provide witnesses and informants with reasonable protection. 5 38 Although courts have yet to tie this doctrine to nondisclosure of witness identities, the duty to protect and witness nondisclosure interact in three impor- tant ways. First, nondisclosure is itself an effective means of pro- viding protection; the defendant cannot injure a witness he can- not identify. Second, nondisclosure advances the important policies underlying the duty to protect: encouragment of coopera- tion, reciprocation for citizen service, and prevention of injury.        Finally, witness nondisclosure responds to the primary criti-cism of the "reasonable protection" rule. Commentators have chal-lenged the duty to protect witnesses as ultimately frustrating lawenforcement efforts by imposing excessive costs on the state anddemands on authorities' time.53 9 By refusing to order disclosure of witness names, courts can blunt this criticism. Nondisclosureeliminates the need for costly physical protection during the cru-cial pre-testimony period. 54 0 Once the witness has testified, thescope of the duty to protect should diminish significantly; sincethe witness has already done his damage and sentencing may beimminent, the defendant will normally hesitate to kill or injurethe witness who has told his story at trial.        d. Use of Continuances to Facilitate Preparation. By allowing thedefense to prepare for cross-examination, mid-trial continuancesmay mitigate the deleterious effects of nondisclosure. Severalcourts have focused on the defense's failure to seek a continuancein upholding convictions against wrongful nondisclosure at-tacks. 5 4 ' Mid-trial continuances protect the defendant's right to       Arguments for nondisclosure are even stronger where the prosecution intends to call a witness only for purposes of rebuttal. United States v. Windham, 489 F.2d 1389, 1392 (5th Cir. 1974) ("Rebuttal witnesses are a recognized exception to all witness disclosure re- quirements."); Breedlove v. State, 295 So. 2d 654, 655 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1975). But see People v. Manley, 19 Ill. App. 3d 365, 371, 311 N.E.2d 593, 598 (1974) (prosecutor must disclose rebuttal witness once he forms intent to call that witness).    538 See e.g., Schuster v. City of New York, 5 N.Y.2d 75, 80-81, 154 N.E.2d 534, 537, 180 N.Y.S.2d 265, 269 (1958) ("[Tlhe public ... owes a special duty to use reasonable care for the protection of persons who have collaborated with it in the arrest or prosecution of criminals, once it reasonably appears that they are in danger due to their collaboration.");see generally notes 468-503 and accompanying text supra; see also Comment, note 497 supra.    "9 See notes 498-99 and accompanying text supra.    540 Other possible means of protection include relocation of the prospective witness, and the assumption of an alias. These devices, however, are unavailable in providing pre- testimony protection.    541 See United States v. Pennick, 500 F.2d 184, 187 (10th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1051 (1974); Siblisk v. State, 263 Ind. 651, 656, 336 N.E.2d 650, 653 (1975).<pagebreak> 222                            CORNELL LAW REVIEW                           [Vol. 65:127confrontation without infringing upon his right to a speedy         5 42 trial.         The prosecutor willing to accept a continuance in return forwitness nondisclosure 543 should impress upon the court the un-usual benefit the mid-trial continuance confers on the defendant.Even when the defendant knows the identities of prosecution wit-nesses and can therefore prepare for cross-examination, he can-not know precisely what evidence the prosecutor will develop ondirect examination. The defense attorney usually must overpre-pare to insure his ability to neutralize all possible prosecutoriallines of attack. Moreover, he must prepare for cross-examinationlargely in the dark. The post-direct-examination continuanceeliminates these problems. Counsel need not speculate; he canprepare for cross-examination with perfect knowledge of the pre-cise points drawn out on direct. Thus, where the court grants amid-trial continuance, the refusal of the prosecution to release thenames of witnesses may well enhance, rather than undermine, thedefendant's ability to prepare his defense.    542 A number of factors work against the defendant faced with long pretrial delays. Seegenerally Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972). If the defendant is imprisoned, time spentin jail disrupts family life and enforces idleness. As proceedings drag on, the defendantmay be unable to gather evidence, contact witnesses, and otherwise prepare his case.        For defendants on pretrial release, the denial of a speedy trial may result in        loss of employment or make it impossible to find work; restraints are placed on        the accused's liberty, and he may be forced to live under a cloud of anxiety,        suspicion, and hostility. The defendant's resources may be drained and his as-        sociations curtailed; and he may be subjected to public obloquy which creates        anxiety in his family, friends and the defendant himself.H. R. REP. No. 1508, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 15, reprinted in [1974] U.S. CODE CONG. & AD.NEws 7401, 7408.       These problems are almost entirely inapplicable to mid-trial continuances designed tofacilitate the defendant's preparation for cross-examination. Concern with the defendant'sinability to prepare evaporates; the very purpose of the continuance is to facilitate prepara-tion. By restricting the duration of the mid-trial continuance, courts can avert undue pro-longation of anxiety and incarceration, while minimizing inconvenience to the court andjury. But see United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975) (rejecting con-tinuances as full solution for harm done by nondisclosure); Howe v. Alaska, 589 P.2d 421, 424 (Alas. 1979) (continuance "an awkward and disruptive substitute for pre-trial discov- ery").    543 In arguing for nondisclosure, prosecutors might suggest a continuance to protect the defendant. On the other hand, prosecutors might fear that a continuance would allow the defendant to "reach" the witness and induce him to change his story during the break in trial proceedings. A complete reversal on cross-examination, however, may do the prosecu- tion less harm than good. A perceptive jury, with prosecutorial prodding on re-direct, would be likely to discern the actual sequence of events, and infer, from coercion of the witness, commission of the crime charged.<pagebreak> 1980]                              LOANSHARKING                                           223       e. Effect of Rules and Statutes Upon the Disclosure Question. Anumber of jurisdictions have dealt with the disclosure issue bystatute or rule. Three types of disclosure provisions are common.The first, which mandates disclosure without exception, generallyapplies only to cases in which the accused is charged with a capitalcrime. 544 The rationale for limiting such provisions to capital of-fenses 5 45 is not surprising-where capital punishment may beimposed, the defendant's need for access to witness identities out-                                                                                5 46weighs the potential dangers accompanying disclosure.       A second type of statute provides for the exchange of witnesslists between prosecution and defense. 47 Such provisions in ef-fect amount to conditional disclosure rules. In Wisconsin, forexample, a defendant's discovery of prosecution witnesses is con-ditioned upon his tender to the prosecutor of a list of prospective                           5 48defense witnesses.   544 For example, 18 U.S.C. ¤ 3432 (1976) provides:            A person charged with treason or other capital offense shall at least three       entire days before commencement of trial be furnished with a copy of the in-       dictment and a list of the veniremen, and of the witnesses to be produced on       the trial for proving the indictment, stating the place of abode of each venire-       man and witness.See also N.H. REv. STAT. ANN. ¤ 604.1 (1974) (must disclose witness list 24 hours beforetrial where indictment is for offense punishable by death).      A distinctive feature of some provisions is that the prosecutor must disclose witnessidentities "in time to permit [the defendant] to make beneficial use thereof." FLA. R. CRIM.P. 3.220(h) (West 1975); see ABA STANDARDS RELATING TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF CRIM-INAL JUSTICE, Compilation, at 260 (1974); UNIFORM RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE421(b)(3)(i) (1974). Invariably, these provisions leave the time of disclosure to the discretionof the trial judge.   545 United States v. Chase, 372 F.2d 453, 466 (4th Cir.) (disclosure required in onlycapital cases), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 907 (1967).   546 The federal statute does not provide for the issuance of protective orders allowingthe criminal defendant to obtain information that may be necessary to his defense. Thestatute mandates disclosure with "no strings" attached.   5   Wis. STAT. ANN. ¤ 971.23(3) (a) (West 1971) provides:            A defendant may, not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days before trial,       serve upon the district attorney an offer in writing to furnish the state a list of       all witnesses the defendant intends to call at the trial, whereupon within 5 days       after the receipt of such offer, the district attorney shall furnish the defendant       a list of all witnesses and their addresses whom he intends to call at the trial.       Within 5 days after the district attorney furnishes such a list, the defendant       shall furnish the district attorney a list of all witnesses and their addresses       whom the defendant intends to call at the trial. This section shall not apply to       rebuttal witnesses or those called for impeachment only.   548 See WIs. STAT. ANN.      ¤ 971.23, Comments (West 1971) ("If the defendant is unwill-ing to disclose his own witnesses, then he is not entitled to learn the names of the state'switnesses."). But in Washington, the courts have required defendants to disclose within a<pagebreak> 224                         CORNELL LAW REVIEW                              [Vol. 65:127         Finally, many states supplement mandatory disclosure provi- sions with provisions allowing for the issuance of protective ordersupon a showing of'good cause by the prosecutor. Most jurisdic-tions emphasize the same considerations in deciding whether toissue such orders: threats of physical harm, bribes, intimidation,economic harm, coercion, and interference with a criminal inves-tigation.5 4 9 In short, application of protective order provisionsentails the same balancing process employed in the absence ofstatutory guidelines.         f. Relation of Informant-DisclosureBalancing. With the growingsophistication of criminal activities and methods of avoiding ap-prehension, law enforcement agencies have grown increasingly                                                                                           550dependent on informants to combat crime. As with witnesses,assorted policies favor nondisclosure of informant identities to acriminal defendant, and courts have recognized a limitedprosecutorial privilege to refuse disclosure to encourage infor-                                              55mants to assist the government. 1        The United States Supreme Court justified this approach inRoviaro v. United States: 552        The purpose of the privilege is the furtherance and protection        of the public interest in effective law enforcement. The        privilege recognizes the obligation of citizens to communicate        their knowledge of the commission of crimes to law-enforce-        ment officials and, by preserving their anonymity, encourages                                                  53        them to perform that obligation.5        In short, nondisclosure keeps the flow of information regard-ing criminal activity open. Disclosure of an informant's identitymay jeopardize the physical safety of both the informant and hisfamily. The involvement of organized crime members amplifies"reasonable time" despite WASH. REv. CODE ANN. ¤ 10.37.030 (1961), which provides thatthe defendant shall disclose witnesses within five days of receipt of the prosecutor's witnesslist. See State v. Adams, 144 Wash. 699, 257 P. 387 (1927); State v. Sickles, 144 Wash. 236,257 P. 385 (1927).    "9 See Wis. STAT. ANN ¤ 971.23(6) (West 1971); cf. FLA. R. CRM.

The court suggested themagnitude of this problem in Harrington v. State:5 5 4       It is common knowledge that without the aid of confidential       informants the discovery and prevention of crime would pre-       sent such a formidable task as practically to render hopeless the       efforts of those charged with law enforcement. And the alarm-       ing fact that the underworld often wreaks vengeance upon in-       formers would unquestionably deter the giving of such infor-       mation if the identity of the informer should be required to be       disclosed in all instances. 555       The benefits of nondisclosure extend beyond particular crim-inal transactions. Law enforcement officials rely on confidentialinformants as continuing sources of information, often regardingan interrelated network of criminal activity. In these situations,disclosure of a confidential informant's identity terminates hisusefulness by "blowing his cover."       Despite these considerations, the privilege of nondisclosure isnot absolute. The sixth amendment promises the defendant aright to confront his accusers and the fifth and fourteenthamendments guarantee due process of law. Thus, when the de-fendant can show that disclosure is necessary to ensure a55"fair                      6trial," the government must reveal the informant's identity.       In Rovario, the Supreme Court outlined in general terms thebasic considerations involved in this inquiry:       We believe that no fixed rule with respect to disclosure is justi-       fiable. The problem is one that calls for balancing the public       interest in protecting the flow of information against the indi-       vidual's right to prepare his defense. Whether a proper balance       renders nondisclosure erroneous must depend on the particular       circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the       crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance  5 57                                                                                   of       the informer's testimony, and other relevant factors.   554   110 So. 2d 495 (Fla.

The circumstances that justified disclosure in Roviaro included: (1)the defendant's opportunity to cross-examine the agents could not substitute for question-ing the person "who had been nearest to him and took part in the transaction"; (2) theinformant played a prominent role in the transaction; (3) the informant's testimony might<pagebreak>  226                         CORNELL LAW REVIEW                             [Vol. 65:127         In applying the Roviaro balancing test, courts have uniformly  held that the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating why  disclosure should be ordered; he can discharge this burden only by showing that nondisclosure will prejudice his case or deny him a fair trial.55         In the final analysis, resolution of the disclosure issue rests within the discretion of the trial court. Only a clear abuse of discretion will result in reversal. 559 Yet the courts have also identified various factors informing this discretion.

The court concluded:       To require the state to reveal the informer's identity in every instance where       that person has witnessed and helped arrange the drug transaction, without       first determining whether the informer's testimony will be at all relevant or       necessary to the defense, would unreasonably cripple the state's efforts at drug       law enforcement.<pagebreak>1980]                              LOANSHARKING                                           227 event, 5 61 whether the identity of the crime's perpetrator is in is-                                                                                     5 63 and sue, 5 62 whether the defendant has claimed entrapment,Id. at 201, 549 P.2d at 279.       Influencing the court's decision was the fact that at an in camera hearing, the infor- mant neither contradicted nor varied the police account of the offense. The cQurt con- tinued by distinguishing Roviaro:        [I]n Roviaro, the Government's informer was the sole participant, other than the        accused, in the transaction charged. The informer was the only witness in a        position to amplify or contradict the testimony of the Government witnesses. In        the case before us [the] agent ... was the dominant moving party in the trans-        actions, not the informer. Id. The teaching of Robinson comports with Roviaro. An overeagerness to give determina- tive effect to the informant's active participation ignores the balancing approach mandated by Roviaro. Following Robinson, courts should consider all relevant factors in passing on the disclosure issue.       For a discussion of the Robinson decision, see Note, 7 N.M. L. REv. 241 (1977).    561 Generally, the prosecution need not disclose the identity of an informer who merely observed a criminal act. In Doe v. State, 262 So. 2d 11 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1972), for example, the court ruled that disclosure of the informant's identity was not required where the informant witnessed the sale of heroin to an undercover agent but did nothing in advance to prepare for the sale. Id. at 13. See Commonwealth v. Swenson, 368 Mass. 268, 331 N.E.2d 893, 898-900 (1975) (no error in failure of trial judge to require disclosure of informant's identity where informer witnessed a robbery and defendant did not show that informant was necessary to prepare defense); State v. Oliver, 50 N.J. 39, 42, 231 A.2d 805, 807 (1967) (disclosure of an informant who merely accompanied police officer to bar used for bookmaking activities not required). Notwithstanding this general rule, the presence of an informant at a staged offense may complicate the disclosure issue-at least when the defense rests on allegations of entrapment or mistaken identity.     M See People v. Durazo, 52 Cal. 2d 354, 356, 340 P.2d 594, 596 (1959) (disclosure warranted where informant could possibly contradict government witness's identification of defendant); People v.

App. 1976) (trial court erred in  not disclosing informant's identity where informant could corroborate defendant's account  of entrapment and possibly identify individual who gave defendant controlled substance), with United States v. Eddings, 478 F.2d 67 (6th Cir. 1973) (disclosure properly withheld  where the defendant freely admitted purchasing non-tax-paid whiskey with the intent to  subsequently sell it); United States v.

The defendant typically seeks informant disclosure in hissearch for exculpatory witnesses, while he seeks witness disclosuremerely to prepare for cross-examination. Similarly, whileprosecutors fear that "blowing the cover" of informants will elimi-nate continuing sources of information, their reluctance to witnessdisclosure normally involves only the case at hand. Two pros-ecutorial concerns, however, apply in both situations-danger ofinjury or death resulting from disclosure and the resulting detri-mental effect on cooperation with law enforcement authorities. 5 65narcotics agent; "[ilt is inconceivable that anything the informer might have said ... wouldmaterially have aided appellants in setting up a defense of entrapment"); United States v.Simonetti, 326 F.2d 614 (2d Cir. 1964) (where record contained ample proof that defen-dant was guilty of failing to register as a person in business of accepting bets; disclosurenot warranted where no evidence of entrapment existed and informant's testimony wouldbe only cumulative); State v. Dolce, 41 N.J. 422, 436, 197 A.2d 185, 192 (1964) (absenttestimony by defendant giving rise to inference that "his was an innocent mind free ofany intention to acquire stolen certificates until it was transmuted into a criminal mind bythe ...enticement of ...the officers," there was no need to require disclosure of infor-mant's identity).   564Defendants often request disclosure of an informant's identity when the informantwas instrumental in setting up the illegal transaction or contributed to the atmosphere thatfacilitated its occurrence. Most courts deny disclosure despite these circumstances. SeeUnited States v. Russ, 362 F.2d 843 (2d Cir.) (nondisclosure not error where informantmerely introduced government agent to defendant and then left while negotiations for saleof narcotics proceeded), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 932 (1966); State v. Boone, 125 N.J. Super. 112, 113-14, 309 A.2d 1, 2 (A.D. 1973) (where informant's transaction merely confirmedpolice suspicions that defendant possessed "dangerous substance" but informant did notparticipate in the crime charged, trial court did not err in refusing disclosure). Somecourts, however, have considered the "set up" as a factor favoring disclosure. See Gilmorev. United States, 256 F.2d 565, 567 (5th Cir. 1958) (informant introduced defendant toundercover agent and helped set up "friendly" atmosphere between them). There, theFifth Circuit stated:       Here [the informant] ...was an active participant in setting the stage, in creat-       ing the atmosphere of confidence beforehand and in continuing it by his close       presence during the moments of critical conversation [when the drug sale was       arranged] ....As [the informant] was a principal actor before and during this       performance, who he was and what he knew was certainly material and rele-       vant. In this testimony there might have been the seeds of innocence, of sub-       stantial doubt, or overwhelming corroboration. As the inferences from it cov-        ered the full spectrum from innocence to guilt, the process of truth-finding,       which should be the aim of every trial, compelled its disclosure.   565 See United States v. Clardy, 540 F.2d 439, 442 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 963(1976); United States v.

The defense's interest incalling an informant who participated in the alleged criminalactivity-an interest forfeited entirely if the informant's name isnot disclosed-does not apply in the witness context. A witness, bydefinition, will appear at trial, and the defense may question himconcerning the transaction whether or not his identity has previ-ously been disclosed. On the other hand, the defendant's interestin effective cross-examination is irrelevant to the informant disclo-sure issue when the prosecution does not intend to transform theinformant into a witness.                                             V      PROOF PROBLEMS POSED BY WITNESS FEAR-EVIDENTIARY                 OBSTACLES AND ALTERNATIVES IN COPING                     WITH THE RECALCITRANT WITNESS      The scared witness may be no witness at all. Despite legaldoctrines designed to provide protection, a frightened witnessmay refuse to testify, claim failure of memory, or spuriously in-voke his fifth amendment rights. 5 66 In other cases, a prospectivewitness, after initially providing information implicating the de-fendant, may completely reverse his story either at or prior totrial. The law does not look lightly upon these derelictions ofduty. Subpoena authority, complemented by the contempt power,enables the prosecutor to insist that fearful witnesses testify, whilesanctions for perjury increase the chance that they will testifytruthfully.      Contempt citations and perjury indictments, however, are nopanacea. Where a witness's fear is substantial, he may continue inhis reticence or fabrication notwithstanding the possibility of legalreprisals. When such sanctions are imposed on the victim-witness,they result in punishing the wrong party; the wrath of the statefalls on the manipulated contemptor or perjurer, while theprimary defendant goes free.

To use these tools, however, the prosecutor must first be able to put the recalcitrant witness on the stand. At least where a claim of self-incrimination is asserted, the prosecutor generally will be unable to do this. The law of evi- dence compensates for this problem, however; recognizing the in- creased need for evidence, all jurisdictions admit a wide range of hearsay statements when the declarant is unavailable. A. Calling the Frightened Witness: Recalcitrance and Fifth Amendment       Rights        Although witnesses invoke the privilege against self- incrimination for a wide variety of reasons,56 7 the only legitimate reason is to avoid subjecting himself to criminal penalties.5 6 Theconstitutional privilege cannot be invoked to protect another per-son or to avert reprisals. 56 9 Courts, however, often hesitate to    ""' While the major concern of this section is the frightened witness, the doctrines dis-cussed are equally applicable to a witness who invokes the privilege against self- incrimination for reasons other than fear. Witnesses in the cited cases, therefore, includeaccomplices, codefendants, and victims. Similarly, while this section focuses on a witnesswho refuses to testify on fifth amendment grounds, policies relevant in the fifth amend- ment context usually apply to refusals to testify based on other reasons. We do notmean to oversimplify the issue. For example, the chain of inference created when a co-conspirator tacitly acknowledges guilt by pleading the fifth differs from the inferentialsequence produced by an alleged victim openly refusing to take the stand. In both cases, however, the likely result is the same-prejudice to the defendant based on technicallyinadmissable "proof."    568 Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 66-67 (1905); Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 597(1895). See also In re Master Key, 507 F.2d 292, 293 (9th Cir. 1974) (possibility, not likeli-hood, of criminal prosecution required).   "' See State v.

United States, 340 U.S. 367 (1951), the Supreme Courtheld that as to "each question to which a claim of privilege is directed, the court mustdetermine whether the answer to that particular question would subject the witness to a'real danger' of further crimination." Id. at 374.      Various considerations impinge on a witness's ability to invoke the fifth amendment.For example, if a witness pleads guilty to a related charge, the privilege is not available asto questions concerning that crime. See, e.g., Namet v. United States, 373 U.S. 179, 182(1963); Commonwealth v. Martin, 362 N.E.2d 507, 510-11 (Mass. 1977); State v. Kendrick,538 P.2d 313, 314 (Utah 1975).

Goals in Calling the Recalcitrant Witness        For several reasons, the prosecution may wish to call a witnesseven when forewarned of his intention to invoke the fifthamendment. The prosecutor may believe that the witness, whenfaced with the formality of the courtroom or the imminent possi-bility of a contempt citation, will change his mind and testify. Theprosecutor may call the recalcitrant witness to avert the inferencethat the witness's testimony was damaging to his case,57 2 or to es-tablish the witness's unavailability and bring special hearsay rulesinto play. 57 3 Finally, the prosecutor may wish to call therecalcitrant witness to raise the improper inference from his si-lence that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged.witness can appeal his conviction.

Abbott, 275 Or. 611, 616-17 552 P.2d 238, 241 (1976) (affirming conviction where prosecution called known recalcitrant witness who had "no privilege to remain silent"). See generally Note, Exercise of the PrivilegeAgainst Self-Incrimination by Witness and Codefendants: The Effect Upon the Accused, 33 U. Cm. L. REv. 151 (1965).   s72Courts will usually not permit calling the recalcitrant witness solely for this purpose. See, e.g., People v. Pollack, 21 N.Y.2d 206, 211, 234 N.E.2d 223, 225, 287 N.Y.S.2d 49, 52 (1967); Commonwealth v. Greene, 445 Pa. 228, 230, 285 A.2d 865, 866 (1971). But see State v. Abbott, 24 Or. App. 111, 114, 544 P.2d 620, 621 (calling recalcitrant witness al- lowed to rebut possible "adverse inference" from not calling), affd, 275 Or. 611, 552 P.2d 238 (1976). jurisdictions are split on whether or not a missing witness instruction is neces- sary in these cases. One court has held that an instruction should be given where the prosecution uses the witness's absence against the defendant. See United States v. Maloney, 262 F.2d 535, 538 (2d Cir. 1959). Another placed discretion for an instruction's use solely within the domain of the trial court. United States v. Bautista, 509 F.2d 675, 678 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 976 (1975). Still others find an instruction insufficient to counter the prejudicial effect of calling such a witness. See, e.g., United States v. King, 461 F.2d 53, 57 n.4 (8th Cir. 1972).    s3 In those jurisdictions which permit the introduction of admissions against penal in- terest and other forms of hearsay only if the witness is unavailable, a witness's refusal to testify is properly classified as unavailability. As stated in People v.

The ProhibitionAgainst Calling The Recalcitrant Witness        Courts generally look with disfavor on any attempt by theprosecutor 57 4 to call a known recalcitrant witness. Three justifica-tions support this view: (1) the risk of prejudice to the defendant,(2) the protection of the defendant's right to confrontation,                                and                                                                         5 75(3) the deterrance of prosecutorial misconduct.        spell out unavailability of trial testimony. If the rule is to be changed to include        penal admissions against interest, it ought to embrace unavailability because of        the assertion of constitutional right which might be fairly common in the area        of penal admissions.Id. at 93, 257 N.E.2d at 18, 308 N.Y.S.2d at 828. See also Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719(1968). Although the Brown court employed language such as "where he is in court andrefuses to testify as to the fact of the admission on the ground of self-incrimination," (26N.Y.2d at 94, 257 N.E.2d at 19, 308 N.Y.S.2d at 829 (emphasis added)), the decision neverspecifically ruled on whether a simple declaration by the prosecutor or the witness's attor-ney suffices to establish unavailability. In 1976, the New York Appellate Division specifi-cally held that the witness must invoke his fifth amendment rights before being labelled"unavailable." People v. Keough, 51 A.2d 808, 808, 380 N.Y.S.2d 267, 269 (2d Dep't 1976). Holding an in camera hearing to determine the witness's unavailability probably would be abetter procedure. This method establishes unavailability as effectively as calling the recalid-trant witness at trial, yet avoids the problems of prejudicing the defendant.   574 There is a dispute concerning the applicability of these rules to defense witnesses whointend to invoke the fifth amendment. The majority view applies the same rule regardlessof who calls the witness:        There is no reason for distinguishing these cases on the basis that the party        calling the witness was the government. The fundamental point is that the        exercise of the privilege is not evidence to be used in the case by any party ....             If the claiming of the privilege is not evidence which the prosecutor can        use, there is no reason why it should be deemed to acquire probative value        simply because a codefendant rather than the state seeks to utilize it.State v. Smith, 74 Wash. 2d 744, 758-59, 446 P.2d 571, 581 (1968) (emphasis in original),vacated on other grounds, 408 U.S. 934 (1972). Accord, Bowles v. United States, 439 F.2d 536 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 995 (1971); Commonwealth v. Greene, 445 Pa. 228, 285 A.2d 865 (1971). In a strong dissent, Justice Roberts in Commonwealth v. Greene stated,"This argument achieves an empty symmetry without significance." Id. at 233, 285 A.2d at 868. Chief Judge Bazelon, dissenting in Bowles v. United States, suggested that there was alesser potential for abuse when such a witness was called by the defendant because of the"jurors' natural skepticism of any 'buck passing,' and ... the prosecutor's right to dem-onstrate to the jury that the person accused by the defendant is someone on whom he has prevailed (through friendship, or by threats of injury) to come to court and then refuse to testify." 439 F.2d at 545 n.13.    575 Courts have adopted various approaches to determine whether reversible error re-sulted from the prosecution's calling a recalcitrant witness. The Supreme Court in Nametv. United States, 373 U.S. 179 (1963), suggested two tests, each relating directly to one ofthese justifications: the "conscious and flagrant attempt" test (id. at 186), concerned withdeterring prosecutorial misconduct; and the "critical weight" test (id. at 187), focused di-<pagebreak> 19801                              LOANSHARKING                                            233         a. PrejudicialEffect. Whenever a witness invokes the privilege against self-incrimination, "a natural, indeed an almost inevitable, inference arises as to what would have been his answer if he had not refused."5 7 6 Since the exercise by the witness of his fifth amendment rights is not evidence and therefore has no probative weight, any inferences drawn from it are improper. 57 7 Further- more, due to the "high courtroom drama"5 7 8 surrounding this kind of confrontation, a witness's assertion of his privilege against self-incrimination may "have a disproportionate impact on [thejury's] deliberations." 57 9 If, for example, prior evidence has estab- lished that the witness was an associate of the defendant and was present at the time of an alleged loansharking incident, the wit- ness's invocation of the self-incrimination privilege gives rise to the inference that the defendant is guilty. Similarly, if an alleged rectly on the defendant's right of confrontation. According to Namet, prosecutorial miscon- duct occurs "when the Government makes a conscios and flagrant attempt to build its case out of inferences arising from use of the testimonial privilege." Id. at 186 (emphasis added). This language indicates that the crucial inquiry is subjective, concerned with the pros- ecutor's reasons for putting the witness on the stand. For example, a prosecutor who had a weak case and called the witness for the express purpose of raising the inference of the defendant's guilt probably made a "conscious and flagrant attempt" within the meaning of Namet.        The Namet court further stated that a defendant's sixth amendment right of confronta-  tion was denied if, "in the circumstances of a given case, inferences from a witness's refusal to answer added critical weight to the prosecution's case in a form not subject to cross- examination, and thus unfairly prejudiced the defendant." Id. at 187 (emphasis added). In contrast to the subjective test established for prosecutor misconduct, the test for sixth amendment violations is objective, focusing on the amount of evidence the prosecution offered to the jury. It appears that when applying this standard, the court would look not to the prosecutor's intentions, but to the sufficiency of the evidence without the adverse inferences drawn from the witness's recalcitrance.        Although the two Namet tests were originally developed as discrete bases for decisions, many courts have used the "conscious and flagrant attempt" test and the "critical weight" test as mere labels, demonstrating little concern for the subjective and objective compo-  nents that distinguish them. Further confusion is caused by the courts' interchangeable use of the three justifications, and their automatic use of "prejudice" as a catch-all for any type  of error that may result from the use of a recalcitrant witness.     576 United States v. Maloney, 262 F.2d 535, 537 (2d Cir. 1959).     577 Id.     578 Bowles v. United States, 439 F.2d 536, 541 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 995  (1971).     s79 Id. In DeGesualdo v. People, 147 Colo. 426, 432, 364 P.2d 374, 378 (1961), the court went further and took judicial notice "that in the public mind an odium surrounds the claim of constitutional privilege by a witness in refusing to testify."

Protecting the Confrontation Right. In Pointer v. Texas,5 s¡ the Supreme Court emphasized the fundamental character of a de- fendant's right to confrontation:       There are few subjects, perhaps, upon which this Court and       other courts have been more nearly unanimous than in their       expressions of belief that the right of confrontation and cross-       examination is an essential and fundamental requirement for       the kind of fair trial which is this country's constitutional                 1       goal.58        Since a recalcitrant witness's invocation of the fifth amend-ment is not considered testimony, 58 2 the defendant has no right ofcross-examination. 5 3 By calling such a witness, therefore, theprosecution may effectively advance its case without allowing thedefendant to rebut adverse inferences, undermine the witness'scredibility, or elicit favorable testimony.       c. Deterrence of ProsecutorialMisconduct. In United States v.Maloney,5 s4 Judge Learned Hand stated that "[i]f the prosecutionknows when it puts the question that [the witness] will claim theprivilege, it is charged with notice of the probable effect of hisrefusal upon the jury's mind. ' 5 5 Some courts combine thisnotice concept with their concern for "fair play," 58 6 and concludethat placing a known recalcitrant witness on the stand constitutesprosecutorial misconduct. The American Bar Association's Projecton Standards for Criminal Justice concurs:       A prosecutor should not call a witness who he knows will claim       a valid privilege not to testify, for the purpose of impressing       upon the jury the fact of the claim of privilege. In some in-       stances, as defined in the Code of Professional Responsibility,                                                                      58 7       doing so will constitute unprofessional conduct.   580 380 U.S. 400 (1965).   581 Id.  at 405.   582  See Griffin v.

Somejurisdictions maintain that the prosecutor must know for a fact that the witness will refuse to testify. 590 Some go further and place an affirmative duty upon the prosecutor to ascertain thewitness's intentions. 5 9 1 One jurisdiction applies a negligencestandard, basing the decisions on whether the prosecutor should                                                                       5 92have known that the witness would remain silent.        Courts also disagree about the effect of prosecutorial miscon-duct. Some jurisdictions, stressing deterrence, hold that miscon-duct without more constitutes reversible error.5 95 Others main-tain that misconduct alone does not suffice for reversal. 5 94 In thelatter jurisdictions, courts couple inquiries into the prosecutor'sgood faith with an evaluation of the prejudicial effect of his con-         595duct.  CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY is apparently to DR 1-102(A)(5) ("A lawyer shall not... [e]ngage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.").

These are: (1) the type and number of questions asked, (2) the type of inference obtained from the witness's silence, (3) the amount of unprivileged testimony the witness gave, and (4) the sufficiency of the other evidence presented. See, e.g., Moynahan v. Man- son, 419 F. Supp. 1139, 1149 (D. Conn. 1976), affd, 559 F.2d 1204 (2d Cir. 1977), cert.denied, 434 U.S. 939 (1978).    596 Commonwealth v. DuVal, 453 Pa. 205, 218, 307 A.2d 229, 235 (1973). In United States v. Maloney, 262 F.2d 535 (2d Cir. 1959), Judge Learned Hand stated:        As res integra, it is doubtful whether such admonitions are not as likely to prej-        udice the interest of the accused as to help them, imposing, as they do, upon        the jury a task beyond their powers: i.e. a bit of "mental gymnastics," as Wig-        more ¤ 2272 calls it, which it is for practical purposes absurd to expect of them.        However, the situation is in substance the same as. when a judge tells the jury        not to consider the confession, or admission, of one defendant in deciding the        guilt of another, tried at the same time; and, since it is settled that this rubric        will cure that error ... we do not see why it should not cure the error here.Id. at 538. Judge Hand's argument by analogy to the codefendant confession rule has been undermined by the Supreme Court's decision in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). Moreover, a majority of cases have rejected he Maloney view and held the curative instruction insufficient. See, e.g., People v.*Owens, 22 N.Y.2d 93, 97, 238 N.E.2d 715, 718, 291 N.Y.S.2d 313, 317 (1968) ("The stigmatizing effect ... is so powerful that it would be unrealistic to suppose that instructions can cure it .. ."). Another court based its similardecision on the belief that "[a]sking a jury not to draw an adverse inference from a wit-ness's claim of privilege may underscore the inference; even if some or all the jurors hadmissed the inference, the instruction will draw it for them." People v. Giacalone, 399 Mich. 642, 647 n.8, 250 N.W.2d 492, 495 n.8 (1977).      In a recent parallel development, the Supreme Court in Lakeside v. Oregon, 435 U.S. 333 (1978), upheld the court's right to give a cautionary instruction regarding prosecutorialcomments on the defendant's failure to testify on his own behalf, even over the defendant'sobjection. The Court held that "the giving of such an instruction ... does not violate the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth and FourteenthAmendments." Id. at 340-41 (footnote omitted).<pagebreak>1980]                              LOANSHARKING         3. The Recalcitrant Immunized Witness         If a witness initially refuses to testify and a subsequent grant of immunity results in the witness's renewed willingness to speak,acceptance of his testimony is not error. Once the "initial silence [is] broken, the jury [is] no longer tempted to speculate or tacitly infer the respondent's guilt .... [The] abandonment of theprivilege remove[s] the danger of suspicious inference."5 9 7        Some witnesses, however, express an intention to remain si-lent even after a grant of immunity. Court decisions vary as towhether these witnesses may be called to testify. Many jurisdic-tions refuse to allow the prosecution to call even the immunizedwitness who expresses an intention not to talk. As the court stated                                       59in Commonwealth v. DuVal: 1        If the fact of invocation of the privilege is, as we believe, ir-        relevant to the issues and prejudicial to the defendant, it is that        much more prejudicial to permit the jury to observe that the       recalcitrant witness (a person likely to be associated in the       jurors' minds with the defendant) elects to remain silent not-                                                                      599       withstanding the order of the court that he testify.        Nevertheless, one recent decision, recognizing that these wit-nesses have "no privilege not to testify," 600 held that "it [was]proper for the jury to hear [the witness] assert a nonprivilegedrefusal to testify, whatever might be the inferences to be drawn                            60from that refusal." 1B. Admissibility of Out-of-Court Statements        When a fearful witness has made a statement implicating thedefendant but later claims the self-incrimination right or other-wise refuses to testify, the prosecutor will normally seek to intro-duce the prior statement at trial. In such situations the hearsayrule and confrontation clause become the prosecutor's principalobstacles. Exceptions riddle the hearsay rule, however, ensuringthat statements that are especially trustworthy and especially   597 State v.

Liberal hearsay ex- ceptions designed to admit earlier statements made by an unavail- able declarant are particularly useful in cases complicated by wit- ness fear.         1. Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule Not Requiring Unavailability        Sometimes the prosecutor need not demonstrate the witness's unavailability to introduce hearsay evidence; rather, an exception under which the availability of the defendant is immaterial will provide a vehicle for introducing hearsay statements.6 0 3 The prior statement, for example, may appear in an admissible busi- ness record 6 0 4 or constitute an admissible present sense impres- sion 605 or excited utterance. 60 6             In a recent case 60 7 the Sixth Cir- cuit admitted as a "recorded recollection" 608 a statement based on comments the witness made to the Secret Service shortly after an illegal check-cashing incident. At trial the witness apparently re- membered the relevant events, but feigned forgetfulness to avoid implicating the defendant. The court admitted the hearsay on the grounds that the witness's "in-court testimony would be incom- plete because of his insufficient recollection."                      609                                                                              By refusing to look beyond the witness's allegation of memory failure to inquirewhether the witness's memory had actually lapsed, the courtaverted a. difficult subjective inquiry and avoided the anomalousresult of having to exclude evidence because a witness falsely tes-tified that his memory had faltered precisely to avoid presentation                        610of the evidence.    60  See MCCORMICK, supra note 421, at 670.     0  See, e.g., FED.

EvID. 612; note 674, infra. Such use does not run afoul of the hearsay rule because the statement is not offered as evidence. Although the general rule allows all re- corded statements, subject to the court's discretion, to be used to refresh recollection (see Annot., 82 A.L.R.2d 473, 597-602 (1962)), some courts have declined to follow the rule when the prior statement was not made at the time the event occurred, or while the event was still fresh in the witness's mind.

Unavailability-BasedHearsay Exceptions        Although hearsay exceptions not dependent on the declar-ant's unavailability sometimes come into play in cases involving                                                                                            611fearful witnesses, utilization of unavailability-based exceptionsis more important and more common. This is not surprising; theusual purpose and common effect of instilling fear is to render                                                                                             6 12the potential witness, for all practical purposes, unavailable.In order to invoke unavailability-based hearsay exceptions, how-ever, the government must make a good-faith effort to present                                61 3the witness at trial.        Exceptions founded on declarant unavailability reflect theneed to admit otherwise unobtainable evidence. Therefore, thecourt's inquiry logically should focus on whether the declarant'stestimony, rather than his body, can be produced at trial. 61 4 Infederal courts and most state courts, a declarant is considered un-available if he pleads the fifth amendment, 1 5 invokes some otherprivilege, 1 6 or flees beyond the reach of process. 61 7 A few statesstill condition admission of out-of-court statements upon physicalunavailability, such as death, absence, or incapacity. 61 8 Evenin these jurisdictions, however, the traditional category of "mentalincapacity" may encompass refusals to testify because of witness        6 19fear .   611 See generally FED.

Former Testimony. While most courts classify testimony given at a prior proceeding as hearsay even where the defendant actu- ally cross-examined the witness, 2 5 they admit many such state- ments under the "former testimony" exception when the declar- ant is unavailable.62 6 If the prior testimony was given under oath and th& defendant had an adequate opportunity and incentive to cross-examine the witness, the statement is generally admissible ir- respective of the character of the earlier proceeding. 627 Courts sometimes require identity of parties and issues before applying the former testimony exception, but this is "merely a means of fulfilling the policy of securing an adequate opportunity of cross- examination by the party against whom testimony is now offered or by someone in like interest.6n8 The need to show an oppor- tunity to cross-examine, however, bars admission of grand jury statements under the former testimony exception.62 9   620  See People v.

The hearsay exception for state- ments against interest 6 30 rests on the common-sense proposition that self-interest counsels against the making of statements sub-jecting oneself to criminal liability or pecuniary loss. 63 1 There- fore such statements are vested with special reliability, on the as- sumption the declarant would not so jeopardize himself unless thestatement was true. Statements against interest inculpating another, however, entail a danger of unreliability, because they may be made by a codefendant seeking immunity or wishing to plead guilty to a lesser crime.6 32 Courts have therefore takenspecial care to separate statements against interest from state-ments against others.6 33EvID. 804(b)(5).

United States, 391 U.S. 123, 136 (1968).    633 On the other hand, courts have admitted declarations implicating others as well as the speaker where the statement is sufficiently inseverable that guarantees of reliabilityinherent in the contradiction of the declarant's interest permeate the entire statement. As Wigmore states:        Since the principle is that the statement is made under circumstances fairly        indicating the declarant's sincerity and accuracy ... , it is obvious that the situa-        tion indicates the correctness of whatever he may say while under that influ-        ence. In other words, the statement may be accepted, not merely as to the        specific fact against interest, but also as to every fact contained in the same state-        ment. 5 WIGNIORE, supra note 433, ¤ 1465, at 339 (emphasis in original). It is unlikely, however, that this principle applies to hearsay statements of codefendants, coconspirators, and ac- complices. Wigmore himself appears to recommend a special rule for confessions that im- plicate others-specifically, that such confessions should be admissible only against the de-clarant.        The limitation [on admitting statements against penal, rather than pecuniary        interest] is apparently supported by the doctrine ... that the confessions of an ac-        complice are not to be used by the prosecution against the accused except so far        as they are the admissions of a coconspirator; for A.'s confession implicating        himself, and B., the accused, is at least against his own penal interest, and        therefore might seem to fall under the present supposed principle. But (1) the        interest of A. in obtaining a pardon by confessing and betraying his cocriminals        is in such cases usually so important that, according to the doctrine of prepon-        derance of interest .. ., the statement would not even under the present ex-        ception be admissible; (2) the question has usually been dealt with according to        the doctrine of admissions ... and the present aspect has not been considered;        (3) according to the present exception, the accomplice must be shown deceased        or otherwise unavailable, and this showing usually has not been attempted in        such cases.<pagebreak>                                CORNELL LAW REVIEW                             [Vol. 65:127         Although some states admit only statements against the de- clarant's pecuniary interest, most jurisdictions follow the better rule in admitting declarations against penal interest as well. 6 34 SinceId. ¤ 1477, at 358 n.1. The constitutional guarantee of the right of confrontation appears to require this rule. In Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), the Supreme Court held that, in a joint trial, the admission into evidence of a codefendant's confession im- plicating another codefendant violated the latter's right of confrontation because the de- clarant was unavailable for cross-examination at trial. The Court found the admission of the statement prejudicial despite a limiting instruction by the trial judge advising the jury that the statement was inadmissible hearsay. Id. at 126. Bruton has been limited by later cases. See Parker v. Randolph, 99 S. Ct. 2132 (1979) (evenly divided court) (exception toBruton in cases of "interlocking" confessions of codefendants); Harrington .v. California, 395 U.S. 250 (1969) (Bruton violation may constitute harmless error); Smith v. Montanye, 505 F.2d 1355, 1359-60 (2d Cir. 1974) (Bruton applies only where the risk is great that thejury will not or cannot follow a limiting instruction), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 856 (1975); Duff v. Zelker, 452 F.2d 1009, 1010 (2d Cir. 1971) (limiting instruction adequate where defen- dant's testimony placing him at scene with "implication of knowing participation" sup- ported incriminating confessions of codefendants); People v. Rastelli, 37 N.Y.2d 240, 244, 333 N.E.2d 182, 184, 371 N.Y.S.2d 911, 914 (Bruton inapplicable to statements within co- conspirator declaration rule), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 995 (1975). See also Dutton v. Evans, 400 U.S. 74 (1970). Its language also disclaims any intention of applying confrontation clause prohibitions to any "recognized exception to the hearsay rule." 391 U.S. at 128 n.3. But the opinion does rest on the premise that the unavailable codefendant's hearsay statement im- plicating the appellant was inadmissible to establish the latter's guilt. Even though Bruton apparently does not bar all statements by partners in crime inculpatory to the defendant, in such cases courts are likely to examine the evidence carefully to ensure protection of the confrontation right. See United States v. Alvary, 24 CRIM. L. REP. (BNA) 2292 (5th Cir. Nov. 20, 1978).       It is doubtful that Bruton applies to statements against interest made by victims, since in Bruton the Court emphasized the particular problems of untrustworthiness in statements made by codefendants: "Not only are the incriminations devastating to the defendant but their credibility is inevitably suspect, a fact recognized when accomplices do take the stand and the jury is instructed to weigh their testimony carefully given the recognized motiva- tion to shift blame onto others." 391 U.S. at 136. The inseverability doctrine is usefulwhere prosecutors seek to introduce the hearsay statements of victims as well. Assume, for example, that the prosecution wishes to introduce against the defendant, Joe, the following out-of-court statement of a loanshark customer to a friend: "I owe Joe $400; that's 5% per week!"

Because all hearsay exceptions are based on peculiar indicesof trustworthiness that accompany certain forms of utterances, 663application of a hearsay exception to admit statements of adeclarant unavailable for confrontation rarely violates the con-                           664frontation clause.        In California v.

The Court held that since thetestimony had been given under oath and there had been an op-portunity to cross-examine during the preliminary examination,confrontation clause requirements were met. The Court noted,however, that even in the case of an unavailable witness and noopportunity to cross-examine, hearsay may satisfy the constitu-tional requirements provided it is marked by sufficient "indicia of'reliability' " 6 6 -an observation borne out in Dutton v. Evans. 6 8       Grand jury testimony has been held constitutionally admissi-ble under the test of Green; 669 since the grand jury witness tes-tifies under oath and is subject to prosecution for perjury, "indicia                                                     6 70of reliability" are invariably present.       b. Waiver of the Confrontation Right. The confrontation right, apersonal privilege intended for the benefit of the accused, may bewaived.6 7 1 Waiver can occur in numerous ways: by voluntary andexpress relinquishment; 672 by stipulation to the admission of evi-dence; 673 or by a guilty plea. 4 Waiver may also arise out of the   666 Id. at 161-62. For cases satisfying the reliability requirement see note 640, supra. Seealso United States v.

State, 282 Md. 210, 383 A.2d 1097 (1978) (cross-examination at preliminary hear-ing, though not as extensive as it would have been at trial, was adequate for purposes ofconfrontation clause where witness was unavailable at trial).

Coping with the Turncoat Witness.       Sometimes referred to as the "spun witness" or "turned with-ess," the "turncoat," after initially assisting the prosecution, reviseshis story to support the defendant either prior to trial or while onthe stand. Since, by definition, the turncoat made a prior state-ment implicating the defendant, the prosecutor may attempt touse that statement at trial to refresh the witness's recollection,6 78to impeach him with his inconsistent remarks, 679 or as substantiveevidence admissible under the hearsay exceptions already discus-      68 0sed.   675 United States v. Carlson, 547 F.2d at 1358 (defendant impliedly waived his right ofconfrontation when "he intimidated [the witness] into not testifying and, thus, created asituation in which the Government's only means of ... [introducing witness's] relevant andprobative testimony ... was by offering the grand jury testimony in evidence"); cf.Taylor v. United States, 414 U.S. 17, 19-20 (1973) (waiver resulted when defendant volun-tarily absented himself from trial); Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 342-43 (1970) (waiverresulted from removal of defendant from courtroom due to disruptive conduct); Snyder v.Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 106 (1934) (right of confrontation may be waived by defen-dant's misconduct).   676 United States v. Carlson, 547 F.2d at 1358 n.11.   677 Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1966).   678 The Supreme Court supported this technique in Hickory v. United States, 151 U.S. 303, 309 (1894). Chief Justice Fuller, writing for the majority, stated:       When a party is taken by surprise by the evidence of his witness, the latter may       be interrogated as to the inconsistent statements previously made by him for       the purpose of refreshing his recollection and inducing him to correct his tes-       timony; and the party so surprised may also show the facts to be otherwise than       as stated, although this incidentally tends to discredit the witness.Accord, Bullard v. Pearsall, 53 N.Y. 230,.231 (1873) (inquiries calculated to elicit true factsor to show witness that he is mistaken, consequently inducing him to correct his testimony,should not be excluded simply because they may reflect unfavorably on his credibility).      Counsel may use memoranda to refresh the witness's memory so long as the witness'ssubsequent testimony is based upon his own recollections and not upon the writing. UnitedStates v. Morlang, 531 F.2d 183, 191 (4th Cir. 1975). Once the witness denies making theprior statement, however, the examination must end. Furthermore, the prosecutor may notread the more incriminating statement in its entirety, thus placing it before the jury underthe guise of refreshing the witness's memory. See People v. Welch, 16 A.D.2d 554, 229 N.Y.S.2d 909 (4th Dep't 1962).   679 See notes 715-27 and accompanying text infra.   666 See notes 604-57 and accompanying text supra.<pagebreak> 19801                             LOANSHARKING                                        249        These strategies, however, pose substantial difficulties. The general rules of challenging credibility, as well as special restric- tions on impeaching one's "own" witness, limit the ability to use prior statements to impeach. Similarly, in most jurisdictions the hearsay rule presents an imposing barrier to the prosecutor seek- ing to introduce a prior inconsistent statement as evidence-in- chief.        1. Restrictions on Impeaching One's Own Witness        As a general rule, a party calling a witness at trial may not challenge his credibility. This rule, among the oldest of eviden- tiary principles, 68 ' applies not only to attack by inconsistent state- ments, but to all ipodes of impeachment.6 82 Where the witness turns at trial, the rule threatens to preclude impeachment, permit- ting the witness's devastating testimony to go unchallenged. If thewitness turns prior to trial, the rule may bar the prosecutor from using the witness or his previous statement at all.        a. History of the Rule. At earliest common law, a party's "wit- nesses" were his friends and relatives, specifically chosen by himto appear at trial and take a prescribed oath. Part juror and part witness, these "oath-helpers" testified only as to the veracity of theparty calling them, rather than to the facts of the case.6 3 Sincethe calling party had complete freedom of choice in his selectionof witnesses, he could not dispute the testimony of those hecalled. 8 4 As the modern concept of trial by jury emerged, how-ever, the role of the witness dramatically changed. No longercalled merely to swear an oath on behalf of a friend, the witness wasobliged to have some knowledge of the facts bearing on the issueat bar.6 5 Resulting limitations on parties' freedom to select wit-nesses, combined with the complexity of modern courtroom pro-cedure, raised questions as to whether the no-impeachment ruleimpeded just decisions.6 86 In response to increasing dissatisfac-tion with the rule, significant exceptions developed. This trendpresaged a more dramatic response; within the past decade, a                                                                                68 7number of jurisdictions have rejected the rule altogether.    681 See Note, Impeaching One's Own Witness, 49 VA.

Rationale and Repudiation. Courts have offered two mainjustifications in support of the rule against impeaching one's own witness: first, ,that the party, by inviting the witness's testimony, vouches for his trustworthiness; and second, that the power to impeach the witness's character amounts to the power to coerce self-serving testimony.6 88         The vouching theory, an antiquated justification, overlooks the lack of free choice in modern-day witness selection; except when choosing character witnesses and experts, modern-day par- ties, for all practical purposes, have witnesses foisted upon them. 6 8 9 The reasoning of the coercion theory is also questionable. It assumes a significant likelihood that witnesses can be forced to lie, and overlooks more direct and effective means of inducing desired perjury. Moreover, the rules of evidence narrow the types of "coercive impeachment." The defense can impugn only the witness's veracity, and general evidentiary principles aimed at avoiding prejudice further circumscribe available tac-        6 90 tics.         Strictly applied, the no-impeachment rule leaves the calling party at the mercy of his witness and his adversary. If the truth supports the calling party, but the witness possesses a character for untruthfulness, honest testimony will precipitate attacks by the adversary; if, on the other hand, the witness lies, the adversary will waive cross-examination while the calling party is unable to impeach. 691 This pincer movement aimed at the prosecutor frus- trates a reasoned search for truth,6 92 but despite these criticisms, the no-impeachment rule remains in effect in most jurisdictions. The severity of the rule is mitigated, however, by two important exceptions.         c. Exceptions to the No-Impeachment Rule. Jurisdictions following                                                                                  6 3 the common-law rule have embraced one basic exception, 9 sup-     688 McCoRmICK, supra note 421, ¤ 38, at 75; WIGMORE, supra note 433, ¤¤ 898-99; Ladd,  supra note 686, at 76.     689 SeeMcCoRMICK, supra note 421, ¤ 38, at 76; Ladd, supra note 686, at 77.     690 See McCoRmicx, supra note 421, ¤ 41, at 76.     691  See id., ¤ 38, at 75.     692  See Note, supra note 681, at 1019.     693  See generally McCoRMICK, supra note 421, ¤ 38, at 76 & n.74. Pennsylvania common  law, for example, provides that if a party can show he had no reason to expect hostility  and was surprised when his witness turned, he may impeach his witness. Commonwealth v.  White, 447 Pa. 331, 338, 290 A.2d 246, 250 (1972); Commonwealth v. Reeves, 267 Pa. 361,   363, 110 A. 158, 159 (1919). In New Jersey, one may generally impeach his own witness,  but not by use of prior inconsistent statements except in the case of surprise. N.J.

Courts have generally recog- nized two components to this exception. 694 First, the party seek- ing to impeach must show that he is surprised by his witness's testimony. This requirement will disarm the prosecutor who dis- covers before trial that his witness has spun.6 9 5 Second, the party must demonstrate that the witness's testimony is "positively harm-                            696 ful to his cause."        The formulation of the "harmfulness" or "prejudice" re- quirement varies from state to state. 697 As a general rule, how- ever, the testimony must affirmatively injure the calling party's case. A witness's forgetfulness or mere denial normally will notjustify impeachment.6 98 California, however, has liberally applied the prejudice concept. In People v. LeBeau, 699 a prosecution rebut- tal witness denied making an out-of-court statement that con- tradicted the defendant's testimony; the trial court then permitted the prosecutor to impeach by extrinsic evidence the witness's priorstatement. The Supreme Court of California upheld the trialcourt's ruling, rejecting the defendant's view that "all negativeanswers are harmless" since they are not favorable to eitherside.7 0 0 Distinguishing a case involving similarly "neutral" tes- ANN. ¤ 2A:84A, rule 20 (West 1976). Florida, on the other hand, permits impeachment of one's own witness when that witness proves adverse, regardless of surprise, but not by evidence of bad character. FLA. STAT. ANN. ¤ 90.608 (West Supp. 1978). In Johnson v. State, 178 So. 2d 724, 728 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1965), the court interpreted the term "ad- verse" to mean "giving evidence that is prejudicial to the party producing the witness."    194 See MCCORMICK, supra note 421, ¤ 38.    695 See Young v. United States, 97 F.2d 200 (5th Cir. 1938) (prior statement erroneously admitted where prosecutor expected witness to disavow it).    696 McCoRMICK, supra note 421, ¤ 38, at 77. Prior to 1975, federal evidence law provided that a pretrial statement could not be admitted for purposes of impeachment unless the prosecution could show that it was both surprised and affirmatively damaged by the wit- ness's in-court testimony. See, e.g., United States v. Allsup, 485 F.2d 287, 290-91 (8th Cir.  1973); United States v. Scarbrough, 470 F.2d 166, 168 (9th Cir. 1972).    697 See, e.g., Travelers Ins. Co. v. Hermann, 154 Md. 171, 180, 140 A.,64, 67 (1927) (material and prejudicial: "[I]t is not sufficient to show that it is not beneficial to [the prosecutor] or, that it disappoints his expectations, even though justified"); Malone v.  Gardner, 362 Mo. 569, 582, 242 S.W.2d 516, 523 (1951) ("unfavorable" and "material"); State v.

How far LeBeau's "harassment" logic ex-tends is unclear, but arguably the prejudicial appearance of spuri-ous harassment arises whenever the prosecution's questioningpoints toward the defendant's guilt, yet fails to elicit evidentiarysupport.        A second standard exception to the no-impeachment ruleapplies to the "compelled witness." Jurisdictions that require theprosecutor to call all known important witnesses normally permitthe prosecutor to impeach them.70 2 This exception is of limitedimportance because in federal court,7 0 3 as in most state jurisdic-tions,70 4 there is no rule requiring the prosecution to produce allknown eye-witnesses to a crime. Prosecutors in these jurisdictions,however, may find refuge in another branch of the "compelledwitness" exception. A number of cases recognize that where aparty must, for all practical purposes, call a witness to the stand,impeachment is permissible. 70 5 In loansharking cases, the victimshould qualify as such a witness.   701 Id.

Bryant, 461 F.2d 912, 916 n.1 (6th Cir. 1972).   704 In Pennsylvania, if the prosecutor believes that a potential witness is unreliable orunworthy of belief, there is no duty to call that witness even though his name appears onan indictment or he is an eyewitness. Commonwealth v. DiGiacomo, 463 Pa. 449, 453, 345A.2d 605, 606 (1975); Commonwealth v. Gray, 441 Pa. 91, 100, 271 A.2d 486, 490 (1970).In New York, the prosecution is under no duty to call at trial every witness to a crime.People v.

Florida also acknowledges the prosecutor's discretion whenfaced with a material witness (even an eyewitness) who might prove hostile or attempt toconceal material facts. See Pride v. State, 151 Fla. 473, 474, 10 So. 2d 806, 807 (1942).Similarly, the courts of Massachusetts and New Jersey recognize the prosecutor's wide dis-cretion in calling witnesses whom the prosecutor does not trust.

The witness may be called in the hope that he will testify favorably; however, if the witness proves adverse, impeachment will be al- lowed.

McCormick, citing a number of cases, states:         The power to call witnesses is perhaps most often exercised when the prosecu-         tion expects that a necessary witness will be hostile and desires to escape the         necessity of calling him and being cumbered by the traditional rule against im-         peaching one's own witness.

Defining Inconsistency. To be found inconsistent, the priorstatement need not diametrically contradict the witness's currenttestimony. 18 In fact, "inconsistencies may be found in changes inposition; they may be implied through silence; and they may alsobe found in denial of recollection.""7 1 9                   The federal courts, inevaluating "inconsistency," apply a reasonableness test. Introduc-tion of the prior utterance is permitted if, upon comparing thetwo statements in their entirety, a reasonable man would find thattheir effect is to produce inconsistent beliefs:       The contradiction need not be "in plain terms. [Inconsistency       exists] if the proferred testimony, taken as a whole, either by       what it says or by what it omits to say, affords some indication       that the fact was different from the testimony of the witness                                             7 20       whom it sought to contradict."For example, if a witness before the grand jury explained in detailthe loansharking operation of the defendant, yet at trial statedthat he could not recall the events in question, the court probablywould find his failure to remember inconsistent with his previousgrand jury testimony. Consequently, the prosecution would be al-   716 Id.   717 Id. ¤ 38, at 75.   718 The court exercises its discretion in determining the inconsistency issue (UnitedStates v.

Morgan, 555 F.2d 238, 242(9th Cir. 1977) ) by looking to the circumstances of the individual case (United States v.Rogers, 549 F.2d 490, 496 (8th Gir. 1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 918 (1977)). Jurisdictionsvary as to the types of utterances that may be offered as prior inconsistent statements. NewYork, for example, requires either that the statement be oral and given under oath, or thatthe statement be written and signed by the witness. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW ¤ 60.35(1)(McKinney 1971).   7" United States v. Rogers, 549 F.2d 490, 496 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 918(1977). See 3 WEINSTEIN, supra note 460, 607[06], at 607-23.

Use of prior inconsistent statements to impeach necessarily increases the risk of prejudicial error because juries, in spite of cautionary instructions, may con- sider the statements probative of the defendant's guilt. 7 1' Con- sequently, courts may refuse to allow the prosecution to place otherwise inadmissible evidence before the jury under the guise of impeachment.7 21           The Federal Rules of Evidence, for example, while no longer requiring a showing of surprise and affirmative damage as prerequisites to impeachment of the turncoat wit- ness, 723 subject all evidence to a "probative value versus unfair prejudice" analysis, 72 4 an exercise assigned to the discretion of the                 725 trial court.       The concern with possible prejudice and misleading of thejury is particularly well-founded where the prosecutor knows that the witness intends to repudiate his earlier statement.72 6 Aware that the witness will not provide helpful evidence, the prosecutorwould normally not call such a witness at all. The defense will   721  In United States v. DeSisto, 329 F.2d 929, 933 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 979 (1964), the court refuted the notion that jurors could perform the mental gymnastics necessary to separate the impeachment function of prior inconsistent statements from their use as substantive evidence.   722 Both the length and detail of the prior statement bear on the issue of undue prej- udice. While the precise amount of the prior statement ordinarily admissible to impeach the witness is dnclear, it appears that the prosecutor may not read an entire, lengthyaffidavit. People v. Cathey, 38 A.D.2d 976, 331 N.Y.S.2d 837 (2d Dep't 1972).   723 FED. R. EVID. 607 provides: "The credibility of a witness may be attacked by anyparty, including the party calling him." See also United States v. Alvarez, 548 F.2d 542, 543 n.3 (5th Cir. 1977).   724 FED. R. EVID. 403 provides:       Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substan-       tially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or       misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or       needless presentation of cumulative evidence.   722 See United States v. Robinson, 544 F.2d 611, 616 (2d Cir. 1976), affd on rehearing, 560 F.2d 507 (1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 905 (1978).   726 In United States v. Morlang, 531 F.2d 183 (4th Cir. 1975), the prosecutor called a witness whose testimony he knew would tend to exonerate the defendant. The appellate court found that the "real purpose for calling [the witness] was apparently to elicit from him a denial that he had ever had any conversation with a fellow prisoner in which he implicated [the defendant]." Id. at 188. Once he received the denial, the prosecutor intro- duced the incriminating prior statement. The appellate court reversed the conviction and condemned the prosecutor's actions stating: "Despite the fact that impeachment of one's own witness may be permitted, this does not go so far as to permit the use of the rule as a subterfuge to get to the jury evidence otherwise inadmissible." Id. at 191.<pagebreak>1980]                             LOANSHARKING                                          257argue in such situations that the purpose of attempting to intro-duce prior inconsistent statements after calling the witness is notto impeach credibility, but to submit underhandedly the damaging                                                                                         7 27statements for consideration by the jury as substantive evidence.        Courts, however, should not overlook other factors that coun-terbalance this argument: the uncertainties of testimony, the po-tential honesty-producing effect of placing the witness under oath,and the need of both the defense and the prosecution to discreditinaccurate testimony.        3. Use of PriorInconsistent Statements as Evidence-in-Chief        Traditionally, courts have limited the use of prior inconsistentstatements to impeachment of witnesses or refreshing recollection,reasoning that because such statements constitute hearsay, theyare inadmissible to prove the truth of their content.7 28 The logicof the hearsay rule, however, seems inappropriate in this context.In most instances in which the hearsay rule applies, opposingcounsel has no opportunity to cross-examine the maker of theproferred hearsay statement. Therefore the hearsay rule serves toprotect the opposing party by barring admission of the statementas substantive evidence. In the turncoat witness context, however,the witness is the original speaker and is thus available for cross-examination.72 9 Furthermore, given the effect of the passage oftime upon human memory, the prior statement is often likely to                                                           730be more accurate than testimony at trial.   727 See generally Ordover, Surprise! That Damaging Turncoat Witness Is Still With Us: AnAnalysis of Federal Rules of Evidence 607, 801(d)(1)(A), and 403, 5 HOFSTRA L. REv. 65, 70(1976).      When the prosecutor uses prior inconsistent statements for impeachment purposes,the judge must give an immediate instruction cautioning the jury against considering theevidence as probative of the defendants guilt. See People v. Welch, 16 A.D.2d 554, 558,229 N.Y.S.2d 909, 914 (4th Dep't 1962). Failure to give such an instruction is reversibleerror, whether or not the defendant requested the instruction. People v. Carroll, 37A.D.2d 1015, 1017, 325 N.Y.S.2d 714, 717 (3d Dep't 1971). See also N.Y. CauM. PRoc. LAw.¤ 60.35(2) (McKinney 1971). The instruction must be precise (Commonwealth v. Blose, 160Pa. Super. 165, 172, 50 A.2d 742, 745 (1947) (judge's failure to state unequivocally thatprior inconsistent statements apply only to question of witness's credibility constitutes er-ror)), and may not leave any doubt that the statement affects solely the credibility of thewitness and not the guilt of the defendant (Commonwealth v. Pimental, 363 N.E.2d 1343, 1348 (Mass. App. Ct. 1977)).   728 McCoRmicK, supra note 421, ¤ 251, at 601.   7129 See 56 YALE L.J. 583, 586 (1947). See also DiCarlo v. United States, 6 F.2d 364,367-68 (2d Cir. 1925) (Hand, J.)

Furthermore, prosecutors would notbe forced to engage in subterfuge in order to introduce what ispotentially the most relevant evidence in their case. Largely as aresult of these considerations, the Model Code of Evidence pro-vides: "Evidence of a hearsay declaration is admissible if the juryfinds that the declarant ... is present and subject to cross exami-nation.7 3 2       Despite the Model Code's wholesale abandonment of the or-thodox rule and similar moves in several states,73 3 most jurisdic-tions still refuse to allow the introduction of prior inconsistentstatements as substantive evidence. 734 The Federal Rules of Evi- dence, the handiwork of both reformers and traditionalists, strike acompromise between these extremes. Defining some prior incon-sistent statements as nonhearsay, Federal Rule 801(d) (1) providesfor their admission as substantive evidence, when       [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to       cross-examination concerning the statment, and the statement is       (A) inconsistent with his testimony, and was given under oath       subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other       proceeding, or in a deposition ....Inconsistent testimony given before a grand jury, during a formertrial, or during an immigration hearing is admissable under thisprovision.7 3 5 Any prior signed statement which the witness 7 af-                           36firms as truthful may also be admitted as substantive evidence.   731For an example of a case involving a fearful recalcitrant witness, see State v. Cac-cavale, 58 N.J. Super. 560, 157 A.2d 21 (A.D. 1959).   732 MODEL CODE OF EVIDENCE rule 503(b) (1942). The same position is taken in UNIFORRuLE OF EVIDENCE 63(1) (1953).   733See Gelhaar v.

While individual states do not always apply the labels used inthis chart to identify their statute, these labels serve to categorizestatutes by functional characteristics.     Although the chart does not include the small loans laws orstatutes modeled after the Uniform Consumer Credit Code, thesestatutes contain provisions of possible value in controlling loan-shark activities. These statutes require that a person who engagesin the business of making loans must obtain a license and mustannually provide appropriate state authorities with informationconcerning the business. The statutes usually set limits on interestrates and require disclosure, usually in writing, to the customer ofall charges and rates.7 3 7 The chart also does not include statutesproscribing racketeering 7 3 8 or engaging in organized crime.7 3 9     The statutes in the chart have been separated into elementsto facilitate structural comparison.
